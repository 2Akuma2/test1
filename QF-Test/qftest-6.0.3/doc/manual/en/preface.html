<p>
      As the name indicates, Quality First Software GmbH is dedicated to quality assurance for the software development
      process. Our contribution to this area is the product QF-Test the manual of which you are
      currently reading.
    </p>
    
<p>
      QF-Test is a professional tool for automating functional tests for Java or web applications
      with a graphical user interface. Depending on size and structure of a company the ungrateful
      task of testing sometimes falls to a QA department or team, sometimes to the developers and
      sometimes to the unlucky customer. Users of QF-Test are therefore usually developers or testers
      with varying knowledge about software development and testing in general and Java or web
      GUIs in particular.
    </p>
    
<p>
      
<span class="margin"><span class="note"><img src="../icons/video.png" width="32" height="32" border="0" alt="Video" title="Video"></span></span>
      The video <a href="https://www.qfs.de/en/yt/overview-42.html" class="videolink" target="_blank">'Overview'</a> gives
      a general overview of QF-Test.
    </p>
    
<p>
      You will find a more technical overview in the video <a href="https://www.qfs.de/en/yt/technial-insights.html" class="videolink" target="_blank">'Technical insights'</a>.
    </p>
    
<p>
      This manual is the primary source of information for QF-Test. We have tried to explain things in a way that is
      understandable for all users, independent of their technical knowledge, yet provide a complete and concise
      reference. In case of Java specific questions, testers may fare best by contacting their developers who will
      surely be able to assist.
    </p>
    
<p>
      Initially QF-Test did only support Java Swing GUIs. With version 2.0 support for Eclipse/SWT
      was added and web support with version 3.0. Parts of QF-Test and this manual owe to this
      history and most things are explained from the perspective of testing a Swing GUI. In most
      cases the concepts are universal apply similarly to all GUIs. Where things differ, specific
      notes explain the particularities of a web or SWT GUI.

</h4>
      
<p>
        This manual is available in HTML and PDF versions. The HTML version is
        split across multiple files for better navigation and to avoid excessive
        memory consumption of the web browser.  Due to extensive cross-linking,
        the HTML document is the preferred version for online viewing, while the
        PDF version is better suited for printing. Searching should also be done
        in the PDF version since the splitting of the HTML files prevents
        searches through the whole manual.
      </p>
      
<p>
        The PDF version of the manual is located at
        <code>qftest-6.0.3/doc/manual_en.pdf</code>, the entry
        page of the HTML version is at
        <code>qftest-6.0.3/doc/manual/en/manual.html</code>.
      </p>
      
<p>
        A web-browser for the HTML manual can be started directly
        from QF-Test. The &raquo;<em>Help</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Manual...</em>&laquo; menu item will take you to the entry
        page of the manual and &raquo;<em>Help</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>News...</em>&laquo; will bring up the section documenting
        the latest changes. Context-sensitive help is also available for all
        kinds of tree-nodes, attributes and configurable options by clicking
        with the right mouse button and selecting &raquo;<em>What's&nbsp;this?</em>&laquo; from the popup menu. This may not work if
        the system's browser is not accessible from QF-Test.
      </p>
      
<p>
        The manual consists of three parts which are kept in one document for
        technical reasons (it simplifies cross-linking and index
        generation). They may be split in a later version. These parts are

<dd>
          This part explains how to install and run QF-Test and how to work
          with its user interface. It shows how to create and organize tests,
          then continues with more advanced material. To avoid duplication of
          text, the user manual often refers to the reference manual
          for detailed explanation. We recommend that you follow these links.

<a href="reference.html#sec_reference" shape="rect">Reference manual</a>

          This is a complete reference that covers all configurable options, all
          parts of a test-suite , etc. When looking for specific information,
          this is the place to go. The reference manual also serves as the
          source for context-sensitive help.

          The part about technical details contains in-depth and background
          information about miscellaneous topics as well as a comprehensive API
          reference for the scripting interface. Beginners will rarely
          need to take a look at this part, but for the advanced user and the
          technically interested it is a valuable resource.

<p>
        A learning-by-doing tutorial is also available in HTML and PDF versions.
        The HTML version, which is directly accessible from the &raquo;<em>Help</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Tutorial (HTML)...</em>&laquo;
        menu item, is located at
        <code>qftest-6.0.3/doc/tutorial/en/tutorial.html</code>. The
        PDF version is to be found at
        <code>qftest-6.0.3/doc/tutorial/tutorial_en.pdf</code> and
        is also directly accessible through &raquo;<em>Help</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Tutorial (PDF)...</em>&laquo;.
      </p>
      
<p>
        The following notations are used throughout the manual:

<ul>
        
<li>
          &raquo;<em>Menu</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Submenu</em>&laquo; represents a menu or menu item.
        </li>
        
<li>
          [Modifier-Key] stands for a
          keystroke, where the modifier is one (or a combination) of
          [Shift]/[⇧],
          [Control]/[⌃],
          [Alt]/[⌥], or
          [⌘].

          files, user input and program output.

<li>
          In order to transfer at least part of the convenience of cross-linking
          to the paper version, <a href="#sec_howtouse" shape="rect">references</a> in
          the PDF version are underlined and show the target page number in
          small braces.
