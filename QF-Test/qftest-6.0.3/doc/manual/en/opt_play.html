<p>
              When running a test at full speed it can be rather difficult to
              get the focus to QF-Test's window and interrupt the test so you
              can do something different without having all these windows
              flashing around the screen. This is all the more true when the
              options <a href="#opt_hardmousemoves">Actually move mouse cursor</a> or <a href="#opt_automaticraise">Raise SUT windows automatically</a> are activated or when running in
              batch mode.
            </p>
            
<p>
              This option lets you define a key combination (the default being
              [Alt-F12]) that will instantly
              pause all running tests if it is pressed in any SUT or
              QF-Test window (unless multiple QF-Test instances are run
              simultaneously, of course). Pressing the same key combination
              again will resume all tests, unless you manually resume or stop
              any of them. In that case its effect is automatically reset to
              suspend tests.
            </p>
            
<p>
              To set a hotkey, click into the field and press the desired key combination.

              If this option is set, QF-Test will minimize the window of a
              test-suite while its tests are being executed. The window will
              pop back up automatically when the test is stopped or suspended.
              This feature is especially useful on Windows 2000/XP systems
              where programs are prohibited from bringing their windows to the
              top so QF-Test cannot raise the windows of the SUT.

              After replay is finished, the status line shows the number of
              errors and warnings that occurred. If an uncaught exception was
              thrown, an error dialog is displayed. Additionally, a message
              dialog can be displayed in case of warnings or errors or every time a run is finished. This
              option sets the minimum error level that triggers such a
              message dialog.

              When an exception is thrown during replay, the node that caused
              the exception will be made visible and selected. If you don't
              like this, you can turn this feature off and locate the node via
              the &raquo;<em>Run</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Find&nbsp;last&nbsp;error&nbsp;source...</em>&laquo; menu item instead.

              such passwords are en- or decrypted, QF-Test combines the key with the salt specified
              in this option. Without this salt, anybody with sufficient knowledge is able to
              decrypt your passwords to get the plain-text version.

              still useful to prevent obvious plain-text passwords getting stored in test-suites
              and run-logs, and encrypted passwords are reasonably safe from someone who only gets
              hold of a test-suite or run-log without access to this salt.

<dt>Reuse IDs for SUT clients in nested sub-processes (System)</dt>
<dd>Server script name: OPT_PLAY_REUSE_SUT_IDS<br>
              
<p>
                This is a complex option which you should hopefully never care about. When an SUT
                client launches another process that itself connects to QF-Test, the new SUT client is
                identified by the name of the original SUT client with a ':' and a numeric ID
                appended. The first ID will always be 2, with increasing numbers for additional
                sub-processes.
              </p>
              
<p>
                When a sub-process terminates and another sub-process connects, QF-Test can either
                reuse the ID of the terminated process or continue incrementing to create a new ID.
              </p>
              
<p>
                In most cases it is preferable to reuse the sub-process ID. The most common case
                is a single sub-process that is started, terminated, then started again. By
                activating this option you can always address the single sub-process with the same
                client name.
              </p>
              
<p>
                In a more complex situation, multiple sub-processes may be launched and terminated
                more or less at random, depending on progression of the test-run. In such a case,
                always incrementing the ID for a new process is more deterministic.
              </p>
              
<p>
                In either case the ID counter will be reset when the original SUT client is started
                anew.
              </p>

<dd>SUT script name: OPT_PLAY_SUT_GARBAGE_COLLECTION<br>
              
<p>
                By default QF-Test performs a full garbage collection in the SUT once every few
                hundred <a href="control.html#step_ClientScriptStep" shape="rect">'SUT script'</a> executions. This is necessary due to a limitation
                in Java's default garbage collection mechanism that allows an OutOfMemoryError to
                happen for the so called PermGen space, even though the required memory could
                easily be reclaimed by a garbage collection.
              </p>
              
<p>
                When you are trying to analyze the memory performance of your application, these
                explicit garbage collections might influence the results. For that case you can
                disable QF-Test's garbage collection via this option.

                Windows only allows an application to bring one of its own windows to the front if

                option is activated, QF-Test temporarily sets the "always on top" attribute to force
                windows to the top.

<p>
                A modal dialog is a window that blocks all input to other
                windows until it is closed. It is often used to display an
                error message or request user input.
              </p>
              
<p>
                Because the events simulated by QF-Test are artificial, they
                are not blocked by a modal dialog and can reach any
                window. This is normally not desirable, since the existence of
                a modal dialog may signal an unexpected error. Activating this
                option causes QF-Test to check for modal dialogs itself
                before replaying MouseEvents or KeyEvents. If such an event is
                targeted to a window that is blocked by a modal dialog, a
                <a href="exceptions.html#ex_ModalDialogException" shape="rect"><code>ModalDialogException</code></a> is thrown.

                If this option is set, the mouse cursor is actually moved

<p>
                While this option is mainly intended to give visual feedback,
                it can have a positive impact on test reliability because it
                reduces side-effects through events from the underlying system
                that might interfere with the automated test. However, for

<p>
                During event replay QF-Test blocks or delays some "hard" events, i.e. events that
                come directly from the system, for example when the user is moving the mouse
                cursor. This is done to prevent them from interfering with the SUT in an unlucky
                moment. Popup windows, which are used for menus and combo boxes among other
                things, are especially sensitive to such events which can cause them to pop down
                accidentally. Therefore, these filters improve testing stability considerably.
              </p>
              
<p>
                This option sets the maximum time that such events may be delayed. In the unlikely
                case that the filters have unwanted side effects with your application, you can
                turn them off by setting the value to 0.

                will be expanded as needed. Otherwise this situation leads to

                Image rendering in Java applications and web browsers is not always fully
                deterministic. Even within the same session on a display with limited color depth
                the RGB values of an icon image can vary slightly and it becomes worse when
                running tests on different machines. Graphics driver, JDK version and operating
                system settings also play a role. This makes strict image checks almost unusable
                in some cases.
              </p>
              
<p>
                To work around the problem, this option defines a tolerance setting for default
                image checks. For a pixel's red, green and blue color values a deviation from
                the expected value by the given amount is tolerated. Thus exact image checking for
                the default algorithm can be enforced by setting this value to 0 but it is
                preferable to use the "identity" check algorithm instead (see <a href="tech_imagealgorithmdetails.html#sec_imagealgorithmdetails">Details about the algorithm for image comparison</a>). The default setting of 5 is a good compromise,
                allowing checks with differences that are normally not visually perceivable to
                succeed.

<p>
                It is a rather common mistake in Swing based Java applications to access GUI
                components from the wrong thread. Since Swing is not thread-safe, such calls may
                only be made from the AWT event dispatch thread. Otherwise the potential
                consequences are race conditions, leading to very subtle and hard-to-debug errors,
                or deadlocks, freezing the application and making it unusable. Background
                information about this topic is available from<br>

              </p>
              
<p>
                When QF-Test registers an event on a thread other than the AWT event dispatch thread
                it issues an error message including a stack trace which can be useful in fixing
                the problem. This set of options defines the severity of the message, whether to
                perform strict checking and a maximum for the number of messages to log.
              </p>
              
<p>
                The possible choices for the option "Error level" are "Error" and "Warning". We
                strongly suggest that you keep the default setting of "Error" and make sure that
                such problems are fixed sooner rather than later because they represent a serious
                risk.

<p>
                If strict checking for wrong thread errors is activated, error or warning messages
                will be issued for all kinds of events triggered from the wrong thread. Otherwise
                the problem will be ignored for "less relevant" events. Which events are
                considered more or less relevant is arbitrary, based on the fact that there's a
                lot of Java literature (including early Java documentation from Sun) claiming that
                it is safe to create components on any thread and that thread-safety only needs to
                be enforced once a component is made visible. A lot of code follows this pattern
                and the risk for causing problems in this case is indeed minimal. In the presence
                of such code disabling "Strict checking" will cause error messages to be logged
                only for the more relevant problems. If you want to get rid of all thread
                violations - as we recommend - you should turn strict checking on.

<p>
                In case an SUT contains code that violates thread safety it is possible that a
                very large number of events are triggered from the wrong thread. Logging all those
                errors can significantly impact test performance, yet logging more than the
                first few errors does not really contribute much. The option "Maximum number of
                errors to log per SUT client" limits the possible number of error messages for
                this case.

<p>
                
<span class="margin"><span class="note">Note</span></span> There are two versions of this option which are closely
                related. This one is effective during replay, the <a href="opt_record.html#opt_nameoverriderec">other one</a> during recording. Obviously, both
                options should always have the same value. There's one exception though: When
                migrating from one setting to another, QF-Test's components have to be updated.
                During that process, keep this option at the old setting and change the record
                option to the new one. Be sure to update the replay setting after updating the
                components.

                This option determines the weight given to the names of components for component
                recognition. Possible choices are:
              </p>
              
<p>
                
<strong>Override everything</strong>
<br>
                This is the most effective and adaptable way of searching components, but it
                requires that the names of the components are unique, at least within the same
                window. If that uniqueness is given, use this choice.<br>
                
<span class="margin"><a name="web_N104513"></a><span class="note">Web</span></span>Don't use this value for a web page with frames. Use "Hierarchical

<p>
                
<strong>Hierarchical resolution</strong>
<br>
                This choice should be used if component names are not unique on a per-window
                basis, but naming is still used consistently so that two components with identical
                names have at least parent components or ancestors with distinct names.
                That way, component recognition is still tolerant to a lot of change, but if
                a named component is moved to a different named parent in the SUT, the test-suite
                will have to be updated to reflect the change.
              </p>
              
<p>
                
<strong>Plain attribute</strong>
<br>
                If there are components with identical names in the SUT within the same parent
                component you must use this setting. The name will still play an important role in
                component recognition, but not much more than the <a href="components.html#att_ComponentStep_feature" shape="rect">'Feature'</a>
                attribute.

<p>
          The algorithm for component recognition is very tolerant and biased towards finding a match. If the best
          match is not perfect QF-Test logs information about the encountered differences, either as a warning or a
          plain message, depending on the following options:

                If this option is activated, deviations from the expected values during component recognition are
                logged as warnings instead of plain messages. It can be useful to temporarily activate this option to
                increase the visibility of such deviations, either to update the respective component information or
                to seek out false positive matches. For normal testing this creates too much noise and tends to
                obscure more interesting warnings.

<a href="contents.html#toc_sec_opt_robot">Drag&amp;Drop and interpolation of mouse movement</a>
</h5>
          
<p>
            Simulating Drag&amp;Drop is non-trivial. It is made possible
            only by generating "hard" mouse events that actually move the
            mouse cursor.
            On Windows systems, some mouse drivers can interfere with
            these "hard" events. See <a href="tech_draganddop.html#sec_draganddrop">section 45.1</a> for
            further details about Drag&amp;Drop.
          </p>
          
<p>
            To make Drag&amp;Drop as reliable as possible, movement of the mouse
            cursor is highly configurable. Since the requirements for
            Drag&amp;Drop and hard mouse events differ from those for general mouse moves which
            only provide visual feedback, two sets of options are
            provided. The settings for demo mouse moves are ignored unless
            the respective option <a href="#opt_hardmousemoves">Actually move mouse cursor</a> is activated.
          </p>
          
<p>
            Typically movements for Drag&amp;Drop and hard events should be slower and involve
            more interpolation steps than those for demo moves,
            which could slow down a test considerably. All of the
            following values influence the overall speed of mouse moves. A
            little experimentation may be required to get the desired
            effect.

                  between 20 and 200 if interpolation is turned off. With
                  interpolation, 10 is a good value for Drag&amp;Drop and 5 for demo
                  mouse moves.

                  acceleration to 10 or more for high acceleration. Good

                  of steps. Good values are between 4 and 8 for Drag&amp;Drop and

</h5>
        
        
<p>
          These timeouts are essential for reliable replay of tests under
          varying conditions. They define how long QF-Test waits for a
          component to be in the proper state for an event before throwing an
          exception.
        </p>
        
<p>
          Don't make these values too small, so a little hiccup due to high
          load won't interrupt a test needlessly. QF-Test continues as soon
          as the conditions for replaying an event are met, so higher values
          for the timeouts won't slow down execution (except for focus, see
          below). On the other hand, don't set any values higher than a few
          seconds or you'll have to wait too long until you finally get an
          error message when a component is truly not found.

                for a component of the wrong engine from failing immediately, QF-Test first waits for
                the time specified with this option to give the second GUI engine a chance to

                This option defines a default timeout for 'Check' nodes that have no
                <a href="checks.html#att_CheckStringStep_timeout" shape="rect">'Timeout'</a> attribute set and that represent an actual check in
                the report instead of being used for test control flow, i.e. checks that don't
                throw an exception and don't set a result variable or that have a @report doctag.
              </p>
              
<p>
                If your tests include a lot of 'Check' nodes without explicitly defined
                'Timeout' that are expected to fail - which is unlikely for the actual checks
                described above - you may be able speed up test execution by setting this value to
                0. However, it would be preferable to set the 'Timeout' attribute of the
                respective nodes to 0 instead and leave this option unchanged because it increases
                general stability of check execution.

<p>
                As an alternative to temporary modal dialogs some applications employ a so called
                GlassPane together with a 'busy' mouse cursor (typically in the form of an
                hourglass) to inform the user that the application is busy. The GlassPane is an
                invisible component that covers an entire window. If an event is delivered to such
                a window, the GlassPane will typically intercept it, preventing normal event
                processing, which can throw a test-run severely off course.
              </p>
              
<p>
                QF-Test handles this case automatically by waiting until the GlassPane disappears
                before delivering an event, performing a check, etc. If the timeout given in this
                option is exceeded and the GlassPane is still active, a <a href="exceptions.html#ex_BusyPaneException" shape="rect"><code>BusyPaneException</code></a> is
                thrown.
              </p>
              
<p>
                If the value of this option is set to 0, GlassPane checking is disabled and the
                event is delivered regardless. A <code>BusyPaneException</code> is never thrown in this
                case.
              </p>
              
<p>
                The <a href="miscnodes.html#step_ComponentWaiter" shape="rect">'Wait for component to appear'</a> node is a special case. When waiting for a component
                (not its absence) covered by a busy GlassPane, the <a href="miscnodes.html#att_ComponentWaiter_timeout" shape="rect">'Timeout'</a>
                attribute of the node overrides this option and is used to wait for both, the
                appearance of the component and the removal of the busy GlassPane. Thus it is
                possible to handle cases where the SUT is expected to be busy for an exceptionally
                long time on an individual basis without changing the default timeout of this
                option.

                A MouseEvent on a button or menu item is simply ignored, if

                effects during a test, so QF-Test waits until the component

<p>
                If set, this timeout causes QF-Test to wait for a component to get the keyboard focus
                before it simulates any KeyEvents on it. This option actually can slow down a test
                noticeably if a component fails to get the focus, so don't set it higher than
                about 100. A good value is 20.

                When waiting for a component in the SUT to appear, QF-Test
                can't always rely on Java's event mechanism. Instead it has
                to repeatedly scan the SUT for the component. This option
                determines the interval between searches.

                When waiting for a non-existent sub-item in the SUT,

                repeatedly search the complex component for the sub-item. This

              Since version 3.1 QF-Test uses the standard Java regular expression syntax by default.

              back to using the GNU regexp package via this option. For further information about

              When recording images for <a href="checks.html#step_CheckImageStep" shape="rect">'Check image'</a> nodes, non-opaque components used to
              be recorded with a black background. Thus, the image could deviate from what the
              user was seeing. This error has been corrected and normally the background is now
              recorded correctly. If this option is activated, the old, broken mechanism is used
              instead which may be useful if many checks for non-opaque components have already
              been recorded using that method.
