                events from the SUT. If this option is turned off, the algorithm from QF-Test 4.0 and older is used. This
                is worth a try in case a recorded sequence cannot be replayed directly.

                <code>KEY_RELEASED</code> for function keys) as a single 'Keystroke' pseudo

<p>
                For many types of components and sub-items it doesn't matter
                where exactly a MouseEvent occurs. However, if large values
                are recorded for the X or Y coordinate of a
                <a href="events.html#step_MouseEventStep" shape="rect">'Mouse event'</a>, there's the danger that the event might
                miss its target upon replay if the component has shrunk a
                little due to font changes or because the window has been
                resized. This is also a possible source for problems when
                converting a recorded sequence to a <a href="procedures.html#step_Procedure" shape="rect">'Procedure'</a> with
                variable target components.
              </p>
              
<p>
                If this option is activated, QF-Test ignores the coordinates
                of recorded MouseEvents if it thinks that the
                coordinates don't matter for the target component, e.g. for
                all kinds of buttons, for menu items, table cells, list items
                and tree nodes. For the latter QF-Test distinguishes between
                clicks on the node itself and on the expand/collapse toggle.
                When MouseEvents without coordinates are played back, QF-Test targets
                the center of the respective component or item except that the X coordinate for
                items is limited to 5 because item bounds cannot always be calculated correctly.

<p>
                When replaying a sequence during which a new window is opened,

          In order to keep the amount of raw
          event data generated during normal use of a Java GUI manageable,
          QF-Test employs a set of recording filters and packers. These do
          their best to keep everything needed for successful replay and throw
          away the rest. To get an impression of the actual data behind a
          recorded sequence, try recording a short sequence with all of these
          turned off, and with <a href="#opt_recordmousemprc" shape="rect">'Mouse click'</a>

<code>MOUSE_MOVED</code> events are especially frequent. Every mouse cursor

                only the last of a consecutive series of <code>MOUSE_MOVED</code> events is
                actually useful, so all events except the last one are
                dropped, if this option is activated. An example where this is
                not advisable is recording some freehand drawing in a graphics

                As illustrated above, creating a new 'Test call' node for a suite could be
                done by clicking on the &raquo;<em>Insert</em>&laquo; menu
                button, dragging the mouse to the &raquo;<em>Test and Sequence nodes</em>&laquo; item for the sub-menu, so the sub-menu
                pops up, then dragging on to the &raquo;<em>Testcall</em>&laquo;
                menu item and releasing the mouse button.  Normally such a

                &raquo;<em>Testcall</em>&laquo; item and a release. It would fail
                to replay, since the sub-menu would never be popped up. To
                work correctly, an additional drag to the &raquo;<em>Test and Sequence nodes</em>&laquo; item must be recorded.
              </p>
              
<p>
                For that reason QF-Test recognizes a <code>MOUSE_DRAGGED</code> event as
                important if you hover over an intermediate component for a
                while during the drag. The delay (in milliseconds) needed to
                recognize such an event is set through this option.
              </p>
              
<p>
                To record the above example correctly with this option set to
                1000, you'd have to click on the &raquo;<em>Insert</em>&laquo; menu button, drag to the &raquo;<em>Test and Sequence nodes</em>&laquo; item and keep the mouse pointer stationary
                for one second, then move on to the &raquo;<em>TestCall</em>&laquo; sub-menu item and release the mouse button.
              </p>

<dt>Maximum drag distance for 'Mouse click' event (System)</dt>
<dd>
              
<p>
                It sometimes happens unintentionally that the mouse cursor is
                moved between pressing the mouse button and releasing it. This
                movement may be registered as a <code>MOUSE_DRAGGED</code> event, depending
                on the JDK version and the distance of the move. QF-Test is
                able to compensate for small movements and still convert the click
                into an abstract 'Mouse click' event. This option defines the maximum
                distance between pressing and releasing the mouse button that
                QF-Test will ignore. Every <code>MOUSE_DRAGGED</code> event above that
                distance will be left unchanged.
              </p>

<dt>Collect key events into a 'Text input' node (System)</dt>
<dd>
              
<p>
                Another example where a lot of events are generated is
                entering a short string of text into a text field. Each
                character typed leads to at least one <code>KEY_PRESSED</code>, one
                <code>KEY_TYPED</code> and one <code>KEY_RELEASED</code> event. For additional fun,
                the <code>KEY_RELEASED</code> events may arrive out of order or not at
                all, depending on operating system and JDK version.
              </p>
              
<p>
                If this option is activated, sequences of KeyEvents on a text
                component (to be exact: a component whose class is derived
                from <code>java.awt.TextField</code> or
                <code>javax.swing.text.JTextField</code>) are converted into a
                <a href="events.html#step_TextInputStep" shape="rect">'Text input'</a> node. Only true character input is packed,
                function or control keys or key combinations with
                [Control] or [Alt]
                are left unchanged.
              </p>
              
<p>
                When the packed sequence is replayed, only <code>KEY_TYPED</code> events
                are generated. <code>KEY_PRESSED</code> and <code>KEY_RELEASED</code> events cannot be
                generated, since the required key code is system dependent and
                cannot be determined from the character alone. This is not a
                problem however, since text components usually handle only
                <code>KEY_TYPED</code> events and some special keys.

                the option set, but for a typical application that does not

          General information regarding the settings for recording of class names:
        </p>
        
<p>
          QF-Test can record classes of component in various ways, therefore it
          organizes component classes in various categories. Those categories
          are called as the specific class, the technology-specific system class, the
          generic class and the dedicated type of the generic class. Each
          category is recorded at <a href="components.html#att_ComponentStep_extrafeatures" shape="rect">'Extra features'</a>.
        </p>
        
<p>
          The option <a href="#opt_recordgenericclass">Record generic class names for components</a> is checked by
          default. Using this option allows you to record generic classes in
          order to share and re-use your tests when testing a different
          technology with just minor changes to the existing
          tests.
        </p>
        
<p>
<span class="margin"><a name="swing_N101789"></a><span class="note">Swing</span></span>
          In case you work with one Java engine only and you prefer to work
          with the "real" Java classes, you could also work without the
          generic class recording. In this case you should consider to
          check the option <a href="#opt_dontrecordcustom">Record system class only</a>. This option
          makes QF-Test record the technology-specific system class instead of
          the derived class. If you switch off this option you will get the
          derived class which enables you to make a very well targeted
          recognition but could cause maintenance efforts in case of changes
          coming from refactoring. In case to derived classes were obfuscated
          you must not set this option.

<p>
                This option defines the key for a very useful functionality:
                recording components directly from the SUT. Pressing this
                key in the SUT will switch it to "component recording" mode,
                regardless of whether event recording is currently activated
                or not.
                To set an option, click into the field and press the desired key combination.
                The default key is [Shift-F11].
              </p>
              
<p>
                In this mode, clicking on a component with the mouse
                will cause the component to be recorded and added to the
                test-suite if it was unknown before. If more than one
                test-suite is currently opened, the menu item
                &raquo;<em>Record</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Receive&nbsp;components</em>&laquo;
                determines the suite that will receive the components.  The
                <a href="components.html#att_ComponentStep_id" shape="rect">'QF-Test ID'</a> of the <a href="components.html#step_ComponentStep" shape="rect">'Component'</a> is put on
                the clipboard so it can be pasted into any text field with
                [Control-V]. This latter
                feature is very handy when creating an event or a check from
                scratch.

                You can also record a whole component hierarchy at once by
                clicking with the right mouse button instead. This will bring
                up a popup menu with the following four options:

<dt>Component only</dt>

                  This is similar to clicking with the left mouse button. Only
                  the selected component is recorded.
                </dd>

                  between testers and developers in deciding which components

                  components in the whole window are recorded and put into a
                  test-suite of their own. Each unnamed component for which a
                  name will improve testability is marked with a name of the
                  form "SUGGESTED NAME (n): suggestion". The running count in
                  braces is just used to avoid duplicates. The suggested name
                  is built from the component's class and other available
                  information. It should be taken with a grain of salt.

                  This is another special feature that brings up a component inspector window
                  showing the attributes and methods of the selected component's class. See
                  <a href="user_componentinspection.html#usec_componentinspection">section 5.12</a> for further information.

<p>
                Normally "component recording" mode is turned off by either
                pressing the hotkey again or by selecting a component. If you
                want to record multiple single components, hold down an
                additional modifier key when switching to "component
                recording" mode. That way selecting a component will not turn off
                the mode, only pressing the hotkey again will.

                like "javax.swing.JButton", "javafx.scene.control.Button", "INPUT" or

                For compatibility with older QF-Test versions that did not have generic classes, QF-Test
                now matches against several classes of a component when recording, the concrete
                class, the generic class and the system class. This is very useful if you want to

<span class="margin"><span class="note">Note</span></span> There are two versions of this option which are closely
                related. This one is effective during recording, the <a href="opt_play.html#opt_nameoverride">other one</a> during replay. Obviously, both options
                should always have the same value. There's one exception though: When migrating
                from one setting to another, QF-Test's components have to be updated. During that
                process, keep the replay option at the old setting and change this option to the
                new one. Be sure to update the replay setting after updating the components.

                This option determines the weight given to the names of components for recording.
                Possible choices are:
              </p>
              
<p>
                
<strong>Override everything</strong>
<br>
                This is the most effective and adaptable way of searching components, but it
                requires that the names of the components are unique, at least within the same
                window. If that uniqueness is given, use this choice.<br>
                
<span class="margin"><a name="web_N102141"></a><span class="note">Web</span></span>Don't use this value for a web page with frames. Use "Hierarchical

<p>
                
<strong>Hierarchical resolution</strong>
<br>
                This choice should be used if component names are not unique on a per-window
                basis, but naming is still used consistently so that two components with identical
                names have at least parent components or ancestors with distinct names.
                That way, component recognition is still tolerant to a lot of change, but if
                a named component is moved to a different named parent in the SUT, the test-suite
                will have to be updated to reflect the change.
              </p>
              
<p>
                
<strong>Plain attribute</strong>
<br>
                If there are components with identical names in the SUT within the same parent
                component you must use this setting. The name will still play an important role in
                component recognition, but not much more than the <a href="components.html#att_ComponentStep_feature" shape="rect">'Feature'</a>
                attribute.

<p>
                Eclipse and applications based on the Rich Client Platform (RCP) have a complex
                GUI with support for changing perspectives. Such a change causes components to be
                rearranged which can make it hard for QF-Test to recognize them unless names are set
                at least on the major components. This is further complicated by the fact that the
                structure of the components is not what it appears to be - the main components are
                all arranged in a relatively flat hierarchy within the workbench. On the upside,
                RCP based applications have a uniform inner structure based on <code>Views</code>
                and <code>Editors</code>, many of which are named.
              </p>
              
<p>
                If this option is turned on, QF-Test will do its best to automatically associate GUI
                elements with their RCP counterparts and assign names based on that association.
                This can drastically improve component recognition for such applications. However,
                if some names thus assigned turn out not to be reliable over time, they can also
                interfere. In such a case, names can be assigned to the affected components either
                using <code>setData</code> as described in <a href="user_components.html#usec_components">chapter 5</a> or
                with the help of a <code>NameResolver</code> as described in <a href="tech_resolversmodule.html#sec_nameresolver">subsection 50.1.6</a>. Both will override automatically generated names.

<p>
                QF-Test supports three different kinds of views for the
                components of the SUT. For more information about their
                effect on component recognition, see <a href="tech_recognition.html#sec_recognition">section 44.1</a>.
              </p>
              
<p>
                The flat view collects all components of a window as direct
                child nodes of the respective <a href="components.html#step_WindowStep" shape="rect">'Window'</a> node. The
                advantage of this view is that structural changes of the
                component hierarchy have little effect on component
                recognition. This is also its greatest disadvantage: since
                structural information is not available, this view gives
                reasonable recognition quality only if <code>setName()</code>
                is used ubiquitously. Another drawback is the lack of
                clearness.
              </p>
              
<p>
                The complement to the flat view is the full hierarchy.  It
                includes every single component of the SUT's GUI, emulating
                all parent/child relationships. This view can be a useful tool
                for developers or testers that want to gain insights into the
                SUT's structure, but is not very applicable for testing,
                since structural changes affect it too much. As long as you
                don't change the GUI however, it will give you excellent
                recognition without the help of <code>setName()</code>.
              </p>
              
<p>
                A compromise between flat and full hierarchy is available
                through the choice "Intelligent". For this view only the
                "interesting" components of the SUT are recorded.
                "Interesting" in this case means that either the user can
                interact with the component, or it is located at some
                important point in the hierarchy, like the children of a split
                pane or a tabbed pane. In some later version of QF-Test this
                decision may be made configurable as well.

<p>
                When a <a href="components.html#step_ComponentStep" shape="rect">'Component'</a> is recorded for the first time,
                QF-Test assigns an automatically generated
                <a href="components.html#att_ComponentStep_id" shape="rect">'QF-Test ID'</a>. The QF-Test ID of a direct or indirect parent
                node may be prepended to this QF-Test ID. This is useful to
                distinguish between similar components that don't have a name
                of their own.
              </p>
              
<p>
                Example: Imagine two <code>JScrollPanes</code>, one named
                "TreeScrollPane" and the other named
                "DetailScrollPane". Without this functionality, their vertical
                scrollbars would get the QF-Test IDs "scrollbarVertical" and
                "scrollbarVertical2". With this function turned on, the IDs
                would be "TreeScrollPane.scrollbarVertical" and
                "DetailScrollPane".scrollbarVertical". That way it is
                immediately obvious which component is the target of an event.
              </p>
              
<p>
                There are four possible settings:
              </p>
              
<ul>
                
<li>
                  "Never" turns this option off.
                </li>
                
<li>
                  "Nearest named ancestor" is a useful setting, if your
                  developers have assigned names to all major components with
                  the Java method <code>setName</code>. A component that
                  doesn't have a name of its own, gets the QF-Test ID of its
                  nearest named ancestor node prepended.
                </li>
                
<li>
                  If <code>setName</code> is used sparingly or not at all, it
                  is better to set this option to "Nearest ancestor with name
                  or feature". That way either the name or a distinctive
                  feature of an ancestor node will be applicable.
                </li>
                
<li>
                  "Always" is only useful if the option <a href="#opt_nesting" shape="rect">Component hierarchy</a> is set to
                  "Flat". With this setting, every component gets the QF-Test ID of
                  its parent node prepended, which can lead to unusably long
                  QF-Test IDs when components are nested deeply.
                </li>

                Here you can specify your own template file for the Procedure Builder. If a
                relative path is given, QF-Test looks for the definition file in the directory that
                QF-Test was started from and in the default include directory.
