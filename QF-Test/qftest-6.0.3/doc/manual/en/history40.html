              deactivated by default when the SWT plugin in instrumented by QF-Test. It can be forced active by setting the

              QF-Test now again starts correctly with early access versions of Java 9. This was broken after changing the
              Java 9 versioning scheme. The value "9-ea" for the system property <code>java.version</code> does not
              contain the '.' character that QF-Test expected to find after the main version.
            </li>

              In some cases the record button could remain active even after the last SUT client terminated.

              Some web components with JavaScript code that handles events in special ways do not
              react to "soft" mouse events. Besides "hard" events that actually move the mouse cursor,
              QF-Test also implements "semi-hard" events by sending events at OS level to the browser
              window. The new procedure <a href="../../../include/qfs_pkgdoc/qfs_pkgdoc.html#qfs.web.general.clickIncreasinglyHard"><code>qfs.web.general.clickIncreasinglyHard</code></a> in
              the standard library <code>qfs.qft</code> makes it easier to choose the best method and

              The option settings for whether to record generic classes and system classes should have
              no impact on test replay. However, there was one special exception in case of Swing and
              SWT: If the 'Feature' attribute of ComboBox popups and lists was of the form 'Invoker
              class: ...', it was matched only against the class resulting from the current setting of

              In addition to JavaFX components embedded in Swing, hybrid applications that work the
              other way round and embed Swing components in JavaFX are now also supported. This
              includes support for sharing the same event dispatch thread between JavaFX and Swing.
            </li>
            
<li>
              The new operation "Find/Remove unused callables" has been introduced in order to get rid
              of procedures which are never used in your test suites.
            </li>
            
<li>
              The new procedure <a href="../../../include/qfs_pkgdoc/qfs_pkgdoc.html#qfs.check.compareDates"><code>qfs.check.compareDates</code></a> in the standard library
              <code>qfs.qft</code> can be used to compare two date strings in arbitrary format.
            </li>
            
<li>
              The procedure <a href="../../../include/qfs_pkgdoc/qfs_pkgdoc.html#qfs.utils.xml.compareXMLFiles"><code>qfs.utils.xml.compareXMLFiles</code></a> has two new parameters
              for stripping white space and for handling namespace definitions.
            </li>
            
<li>
              The diagnostic information logged for every error and exception now also includes a full
              thread dump of the SUT as well as the SUT's Java memory usage and the current system
              load.
            </li>
            
<li>
              When executing QF-Test in batch mode for report generation or other commands that don't
              run any tests, QF-Test now runs in AWT headless mode if the command line argument
              <a href="tech_execution.html#arg_nomessagewindow" shape="rect"><code>-nomessagewindow</code></a> is specified. This is useful when using such commands from
              a continuous integration server that runs without a display.

<li>
              
<a href="requests.html#step_RequestStep" shape="rect">'Server HTTP request'</a> nodes can now use the syntax
              <code>http://user:passwd@mydomain.com</code> to send requests to secured servers.
            </li>
            
<li>
              The default Java memory setting for QF-Test is now 512 MB and the default Java memory for
              QF-Test's browser wrapper has been increased to 256 MB.
            </li>
            
<li>
              The new <code>ResetListener</code> extension API can be used to influence the behavior
              of the command &raquo;<em>Run</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Reset everything</em>&laquo;, e.g. to prevent a certain client process from being killed or to
              perform additional cleanup like deleting Jython or Groovy variables. See <a href="tech_miscellaneouslisteners.html#sec_miscellaneouslisteners">section 50.8</a> for details.

              Display of large amounts of output from the SUT in the terminal could slow down QF-Test and

              If an Excel sheet contains too deeply nested functions, QF-Test will now throw a
              TestException instead of ignoring those cells. Handling such Excel files requires an
              increased thread stack size which can be achieved by starting QF-Test with the command line
              argument -J-Xss512k.

<li>
              The procedure recorder is now able to create container procedures with standard event

              For WebStart applications QF-Test now also automatically handles the German version of a

              <code>JTabbedPane.setTabComponent</code> could break replay of existing recordings.

<span class="margin"><a name="fx_N212042"></a><span class="note">JavaFX</span></span>

              Recording of events on FX controls embedded in an SWT based SUT no longer produces
              duplicates and checks can now be recorded normally for such FX controls.

              The default compatibility mode for Internet Explorer 10 and up has been fixed and the
              user agent returned by IE for <code>document.documentMode</code> now always correctly
              reflects the current compatibility mode.

              QF-Test now uses a different method for determining the geometry of TEXT nodes in all
              browsers that is less invasive and more efficient. The old method could occasionally
              interfere with JavaScript code in web pages.

              There was a tricky race condition mostly seen in connection with a special kind of
              download, triggered by opening a temporary web page which automatically closes
              immediately. QF-Test now handles such situations and the respective download cleanly.

<li>
              
<span class="margin"><a name="fx_N212111"></a><span class="note">JavaFX</span></span>

              The JavaFX <code>TreeTableView</code> component, which was introduced with Java 8, is
              now fully supported.
            </li>

<span class="margin"><a name="swing_N212119"></a><span class="note">Swing</span></span>

              QF-Test now supports recording and checking of tabs for <code>JTabbedPane</code> components
              which use the <code>setTabComponent</code> method to implement some or all tabs as
              actual components.
            </li>
            
<li>
              If the <a href="datadriver.html#att_CSVDataBinder_encoding" shape="rect">'File encoding'</a> attribute of a <a href="datadriver.html#step_CSVDataBinder" shape="rect">'CSV data file'</a> node is set to
              "UTF-8", QF-Test now tries to determine itself whether the file starts with a Byte Order
              Mark (BOM) or not and handle it accordingly. QF-Test also treats an 'File encoding' attribute
              with "x-UTF-8-BOM" or "x-UTF-8-No-BOM" correctly, even though Java has no direct support
              for these encodings.
            </li>
            
<li>
              When moving the mouse over any image stored in a test-suite or run-log, QF-Test now displays
              the  (X,Y) coordinates and color values of the associated pixel.

<b>Bugs fixed:</b>
	  
</p>
	  
<ul>
            
<li>
              The timeout value of the option <a href="opt_play.html#opt_waitforsubitem">Wait for non-existent item (ms)</a> was ignored in some
              cases, e.g. when performing checks with a timeout.
            </li>
            
<li>
              An 'Extra feature' using variables for a regular expression value could
              mistakenly trigger a BadRegexpException.
            </li>
            
<li>
              In QF-Test version 4, leading and trailing whitespace is removed from sub-item names.
              Playback compatibility was provided for most cases, but not all. This should now work
              consistently.
            </li>
            
<li>
              The context diff for a failed <a href="checks.html#step_CheckSelectableItemsStep" shape="rect">'Check selectable items'</a> node in the run-log now
              includes visual representation for the expected and actual selected states and is shown
              correctly also in cases where there are differences only in the selected state.
            </li>
            
<li>
              Formulas in Excel files that return boolean values or that switch cell types more than
              once are now handled correctly by the <a href="datadriver.html#step_ExcelDataBinder" shape="rect">'Excel data file'</a> node and the procedure

<span class="margin"><a name="swing_N212196"></a><span class="note">Swing</span></span>

              In a hybrid Swing and JavaFX application, handling of Swing <code>JTable</code>
              components was partly broken due to interference from the JavaFX ItemResolver for
              tables.

              There were still dependencies on a newer version of glibc left in the instrumentation
              files for 64bit versions of Eclipse, causing failures on some Linux systems with an old

              In the Chrome browser coordinates inside an IFRAME were displaced if the frame had a
              border defined, leading to offsets when highlighting components and to image check
              failures caused by insufficient automatic scrolling.

<b>Changes that can affect test execution:</b>
	  
</p>
	  
<ul>
            
<li>
              The <a href="miscnodes.html#step_ComponentWaiter" shape="rect">'Wait for component to appear'</a> node implicitly waits for the respective SUT client to connect
              for the required GUI engine. In case the wait fails, a <a href="exceptions.html#ex_ComponentNotFoundException" shape="rect"><code>ComponentNotFoundException</code></a>
              is thrown with a message that explains whether the component was not found, the
              respective SUT client is not connected or whether there is no matching GUI engine
              available for that client. The <a href="control.html#att_CatchSequence_catchmessage" shape="rect">'Expected message'</a> attribute of a
              <a href="control.html#step_CatchSequence" shape="rect">'Catch'</a> node can be used to differentiate between those causes.<br>
              In absence of a suitable client there was an inconsistency in
              older QF-Test versions, causing either a <code>ComponentNotFoundException</code> or a
              <a href="exceptions.html#ex_ClientNotConnectedException" shape="rect"><code>ClientNotConnectedException</code></a> to be thrown, depending on whether such a client was
              previously connected or not. In case your test still expects a
              <code>ClientNotConnectedException</code> you either need to change the 'Catch' node,
              add an additional 'Catch' or prepend the 'Wait for component to appear' node with a
              <a href="processes.html#step_ClientWaiter" shape="rect">'Wait for client to connect'</a> node.
            </li>
            
<li>
              The new option <a href="opt_play.html#opt_errorstatedisabledcomponent">How to handle disabled components</a> defines what to do when
              a disabled 'Component' node is referenced during test execution. In previous
              versions of QF-Test the disabled state was ignored which sometimes led to confusion. The
              default now is to log an error. Consequently, disabled 'Component' nodes are no
              longer re-used when recording.
            </li>
            
<li>
              There is a new option called <a href="opt_play.html#opt_defaultchecktimeout">Default timeout for checks (ms)</a> that - as its
              name implies - defines a default timeout for checks that have no
              <a href="checks.html#att_CheckStringStep_timeout" shape="rect">'Timeout'</a> attribute set. It increases general stability of check
              execution. If your tests include a lot of 'Check' nodes without 'Timeout' that
              are expected to fail, test execution time may increase. In this case you may want to set
              this option back to 0, the old default or, preferably, update the respective nodes and
              set their 'Timeout' attribute to 0.
            </li>
            
<li>
              
<span class="margin"><a name="web_N212561"></a><span class="note">Web</span></span>

              The AJAX toolkit RAP does not use the 'ID' attribute of DOM nodes to define IDs, so the
              option <a href="opt_web.html#opt_websuppressnumerals">Eliminate all numerals from 'ID' attributes</a> had no effect for RAP. This has been
              fixed, so that with the option activated, numerals are now removed from IDs generated
              for RAP elements. In case this causes problems with existing tests, simply deactivate
              the option <a href="opt_web.html#opt_websuppressnumerals">Eliminate all numerals from 'ID' attributes</a>.
            </li>

            QFS is taking pains to support even very old software. QF-Test still runs, for example, under
            Windows XP or with an SUT based on Java 1.5 or 1.6 but for systems that are no longer
            supported by their own vendors we cannot provide full support.

            longer part of the default installation of QF-Test. The majority is still being maintained,
            albeit with limited testing. If you need support for such a system, please get in touch
            with QFS via <code>support@qfs.de</code>.

              When opening a Jython or Groovy terminal for an SUT client, the command history from the
              most recently created Jython or Groovy terminal is copied. This makes it easier to try

              The default severity level for JavaScript errors in web pages has been changed to
              'Warning'. Current browsers simply ignore JavaScript problems by default so that
              treating those as an error caused too much irritation. The setting can be changed via
              the option <a href="opt_web.html#opt_webscripterror">How to handle errors in a web application</a>.

              In newer Java and Browser versions the startup behavior of applets has changed,
              sometimes causing two JRE versions to start up simultaneously. Depending on timing, this
              could cause the real applet to connect as $(client):2 instead of $(client). QF-Test now
              works around this problem by connecting to an applet only after it has become visible.

              There are now two different text checks for JEditorPane components that display HTML,
              "Text" and "HTML source". In many cases the check against the plain, displayed text is

              QF-Test now supports multi-level sub-items for addressing components within an item. A
              typical example is a TextField within a table cell that can now be addressed as
              table@Header&amp;row@:TextField. The syntax is extremely powerful with the potential to
              mix XPath-like syntax with QF-Test's component representation (see <a href="user_subitems.html#usec_multilevelsubitemsqpath">subsection 5.9.2</a>).

              The former 'Id' attribute of 'Window' and 'Component' nodes is now called

              The new option <a href="opt_log.html#opt_suitedirectorymap">Directory map for test-suites</a> can be used to map directories
              for test-suites. This is very useful when working with a run-log from a machine with a
              different file layout (e.g. Windows vs. Unix) because with the correct directory mapping
              QF-Test can locate a test-suite without manual help.

              There are two new special variable groups to conveniently escape special characters.

              The AJAX toolkit RAP does not use the 'ID' attribute of DOM nodes to define IDs, so the
              option <a href="opt_web.html#opt_websuppressnumerals">Eliminate all numerals from 'ID' attributes</a> had no effect for RAP. This has been
              fixed, so that with the option activated, numerals are now removed from IDs generated
              for RAP elements. In case this causes problems with existing tests, simply deactivate
              the option <a href="opt_web.html#opt_websuppressnumerals">Eliminate all numerals from 'ID' attributes</a>.

              With support for JavaFX and its Swing InterOp embedding capabilities as well as support
              for embedded browsers, SUT clients often have more than one GUI engine. This caused
              problems with 'SUT script' nodes in the standard library <code>qfs.qft</code>
              which were relying on the default GUI engine. All procedures with 'SUT scripts'
              now have an optional parameter named <code>guiengine</code> which is predefined
              correctly, so that for example a 'Procedure' in the 'Package' <a href="../../../include/qfs_pkgdoc/qfs_pkgdoc.html#qfs.web"><code>qfs.web</code></a> automatically works correctly in an embedded browser. In the
              exceptional case of an SUT client with more than one GUI engine of the same kind you can
              define the <code>guiengine</code> parameter to address a particular engine.

              QF-Test records generic class, custom class and system class as extra features named
              qfs:genericclass, qfs:class and qfs:systemclass respectively. This is useful information
              and can be used to switch individual components to a more specific or less specific
              class. In case the generic class also has a more specific sub-type QF-Test also records the
              extra feature qfs:type, e.g. "PanelTitle" for a Label that is the title of a
              TitledPanel.

<span class="margin"><a name="fx_N213105"></a><span class="note">JavaFX</span></span>

              JavaFX is the successor of Swing as the standard UI Toolkit in Java 8. QF-Test version 4.0
              introduces the new product line QF-Test/fx that fully supports testing JavaFX applications.
              This GUI engine is nearly complete. Missing at this point is recording of procedures and
              support for handling the embedded WebView as a full-featured QF-Test Web engine is
              incomplete.
            </li>
            
<li>
              Support for the Chrome browser on Windows is well advanced and mostly stable. As before
              with Internet Explorer and Firefox the goal is to hide the browser differences and
              enable a single test to run unchanged on all three browsers. Not implemented at this
              point are various browser dialogs as well as file up- and download. Another current
              restriction is that only one instance of Chrome can be run by QF-Test in parallel.
            </li>
            
<li>
              The concept of generic classes, initially available for the web engine only, has been
              extended to support JavaFX and soon all GUI engines. It is the basis for interoperable
              tests that work for different GUI engines, provides a higher level of abstraction and
              more flexible and robust component recognition. Recording of generic classes is
              configured via the option <a href="opt_record.html#opt_recordgenericclass">Record generic class names for components</a>.<br>

              See the video <a href="http://www.qfs.de/en/qftest/web-gui-testing-reduction-of-complexity.html" shape="rect">Dealing with the explosion of complexity in web test automation</a> for a
              vivid demonstration of the explosion of complexity in AJAX user interfaces. This applies
              just as well to JavaFX which shares the automation problems of a UI built from a large
              number of small GUI elements and for which QF-Test's approach with generic classes fits
              perfectly.
            </li>
            
<li>
              Tolerant class matching when recording: Existing nodes in QF-Test's component hierarchy
              will be reused as long as they match one of the classes of the recorded component. This
              means that when switching to/from generic class recording, no components will be
              forcibly re-recorded. This has no impact on the 'Update components' feature which always
              updates the respective components according to the current recording option settings.
            </li>
            
<li>
              Connection with the SUT is now implemented via the Java agent mechanism by default. It
              is faster, more stable - especially for Java WebStart and Applets - and much more
              flexible and powerful. In case of problems the Java agent mechanism can be disabled via
              the option <a href="opt_runtime.html#opt_connectviaagent">Connect via QF-Test agent</a>.
            </li>
            
<li>
              During SUT startup Jython and Groovy are now loaded on demand, leading to faster and
              more reliable startup. Jython in particular was one of the main reasons for problems
              with Java WebStart. This also reduces the overhead and memory footprint if either of the
              languages is not used at all.

<li>
              Colored syntax highlighting of tree nodes was added which significantly improves

<li>
              The shared terminal now provides coloring of different message types. The new group of
              <a href="opt_play.html#sec_opt_terminal">Terminal options</a> encloses a bunch of new settings to adjust text
              display in the shared terminal. Font size and type can be defined as well as a number of
              regular expressions to highlight and/or filter arbitrary text in the output.
            </li>
            
<li>
              It is now possible to set breakpoints on <a href="components.html#step_ComponentStep" shape="rect">'Component'</a> nodes so as to enter the
              debugger as soon as the node gets referenced.
            </li>
            
<li>
              For a failed <a href="checks.html#step_CheckItemsStep" shape="rect">'Check items'</a> node both run-log and report now contain a context
              diff of the expected and actual values so that all deviations can quickly be identified.

              are now supported.
            </li>
            
<li>
              In places where QF-Test supports regular expressions, e.g. <a href="checks.html#att_CheckStringStep_text" shape="rect">'Text'</a>,
              <a href="components.html#att_ComponentStep_feature" shape="rect">'Feature'</a> or <a href="checks.html#att_CheckItemsStep_items" shape="rect">'Items'</a>, normal text can now be turned
              into a properly quoted regular expression by right-clicking and selecting 'Escape text
              for regular expressions' from the context menu.
            </li>
            
<li>
              Handling of items with multi-line text, e.g. tree nodes, table headers or cells, list
              items etc. has been improved.
            </li>
            
<li>
              Search and replace operations for variables can now be limited further to cover only
              variable names or variable values.

<b>Changes that can affect test execution:</b>
	  
</p>
	  
<ul>
            
<li>
              The <a href="miscnodes.html#step_ComponentWaiter" shape="rect">'Wait for component to appear'</a> node implicitly waits for the respective SUT client to connect
              for the required GUI engine. In case the wait fails, a <a href="exceptions.html#ex_ComponentNotFoundException" shape="rect"><code>ComponentNotFoundException</code></a>
              is thrown with a message that explains whether the component was not found, the
              respective SUT client is not connected or whether there is no matching GUI engine
              available for that client. The <a href="control.html#att_CatchSequence_catchmessage" shape="rect">'Expected message'</a> attribute of a
              <a href="control.html#step_CatchSequence" shape="rect">'Catch'</a> node can be used to differentiate between those causes.<br>
              In absence of a suitable client there was an inconsistency in
              older QF-Test versions, causing either a <code>ComponentNotFoundException</code> or a
              <a href="exceptions.html#ex_ClientNotConnectedException" shape="rect"><code>ClientNotConnectedException</code></a> to be thrown, depending on whether such a client was
              previously connected or not. In case your test still expects a
              <code>ClientNotConnectedException</code> you either need to change the 'Catch' node,
              add an additional 'Catch' or prepend the 'Wait for component to appear' node with a
              <a href="processes.html#step_ClientWaiter" shape="rect">'Wait for client to connect'</a> node.
            </li>
            
<li>
              The new option <a href="opt_play.html#opt_errorstatedisabledcomponent">How to handle disabled components</a> defines what to do when
              a disabled 'Component' node is referenced during test execution. In previous
              versions of QF-Test the disabled state was ignored which sometimes led to confusion. The
              default now is to log an error. Consequently, disabled 'Component' nodes are no
              longer re-used when recording.
            </li>
            
<li>
              There is a new option called <a href="opt_play.html#opt_defaultchecktimeout">Default timeout for checks (ms)</a> that - as its
              name implies - defines a default timeout for checks that have no
              <a href="checks.html#att_CheckStringStep_timeout" shape="rect">'Timeout'</a> attribute set. It increases general stability of check
              execution. If your tests include a lot of 'Check' nodes without 'Timeout' that
              are expected to fail, test execution time may increase. In this case you may want to set
              this option back to 0, the old default or, preferably, update the respective nodes and
              set their 'Timeout' attribute to 0.

<b>Software that is no longer supported:</b>
	  
</p>
	  
<p>
            QFS is taking pains to support even very old software. QF-Test still runs, for example, under
            Windows XP or with an SUT based on Java 1.5 or 1.6 but for systems that are no longer
            supported by their own vendors we cannot provide full support.
	  </p>
	  
<p>
            Libraries that are required for the Firefox and Eclipse/SWT versions listed below are no
            longer part of the default installation of QF-Test. The majority is still being maintained,
            albeit with limited testing. If you need support for such a system, please get in touch
            with QFS via <code>support@qfs.de</code>.
	  </p>
	  
<p>
            Official support has been dropped for Java 1.5, Internet Explorer 7 and older, Firefox 25
            and older (except Firefox 24 ESR) as well as Eclipse/SWT 3.7 and older.
