      to check for the availability of a new QF-Test version via an encrypted HTTPS request to www.qfs.de, either
      automatically when starting QF-Test or via explicit user action. This version information is compared to the
      current QF-Test version and in case a newer version is available a notification is shown with links to to the
      respective QFS web pages.
      </p>
      
<p>
        For technical reasons the following data among others are stored by our provider (in so

        The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to enable the version
        information to be delivered to the user's computer. For this the IP address of the user must
        remain stored for the duration of the session.
      </p>
      
<p>
        Data will be deleted as soon as it is
        no longer needed to achieve the purpose for which it was collected. In case of the
        collection of data for the provision of the version information, this is the case when the
        respective session has ended. To detect web service failures including security issues data
        is stored for 42 days and then automatically deleted.

<p>
        The collection of data for the provision of the version
        information and the storage of data in log files is absolutely necessary for the operation
        of the web service. Consequently, there is no possibility of objection on the part of the
        user. However, the version information query and thus usage of the web service can be
        deactivated via QF-Test user options (see <a href="opt_general.html#sec_opt_update">subsection 37.1.8</a>).

      Since QF-Test 4.5.2 the webdriver file for certain browsers (e.g. Chrome) can be downloaded and extracted 
      automatically by QF-Test. To do so, QF-Test downloads the required files from the servers <code>www.qfs.de</code>,
      <code>github.com</code>, <code>chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com</code>, <code>developer.microsoft.com</code> 
      and their content delivery peers using an encrypted connection.
      </p>
      
<p>
        For technical reasons the following data is submitted along the requests:
      </p>
      
<ul>
        
<li>Your internet protocol (IP) address</li>
        
<li>The name of the file to download, which includes the version number of the file to download.</li>
      
</ul>
      
<p>
        Please see the privacy policy of the aforementioned service providers for details on their data processing.
        To deactivate the automatic webdriver download, you can specify the webdriver to use explicitly in the "Start
        Web Engine" node by pointing the <code>qftest.web.webdriver.driver</code> Java property to the existing driver file.

</h4>
      
<p>
        
<span class="margin"><span class="note">Note</span></span>

        The log files described below may be provided the Quality First Software GmbH support team via email or file upload in order to
        facilitate support services. There is no automatic transfer of such logs by QF-Test to QFS or any third party.
      </p>
      
<p>
        QF-Test run-logs are a critical tool for analyzing automated test runs in order to locate errors in the test
        implementation of the system under test. Besides details about the system environment and executed test steps
        a run-log may also contain textual output from the system under test, screenshots of connected
        monitors or virtual desktops, or the HTML code of the page tested in a browser.
      </p>
      
<p>
        Type and amount of data to be stored in run-logs can be adjusted via the QF-Test run-log options (see <a href="opt_log.html#sec_opt_log">section 37.8</a>). Among those the number of automatically stored run-logs can be specified - older
        run-logs are automatically deleted.
      </p>
      
<p>
        The default directory where run-logs are stored depends on the operating system. The
        current value can be retrieved via the menu
        &raquo;<em>Help</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Info</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>System info</em>&laquo;
        shown as <code>dir.runlog</code>. The directory can also be explicitly defined via the
        command line argument <a href="tech_execution.html#arg_runlogdir" shape="rect"><code>-runlogdir &lt;directory&gt;</code></a>.
      </p>
      
<p>
        In addition to run-logs QF-Test also creates internal logs for the purpose of diagnosis of QF-Test itself or the
        connection to the system under test.
      </p>
      
<p>
        Internal logging of QF-Test is done in five rotating text files named
        <code>qftestN.log</code> with <code>N = [,1,2,3,4]</code>. Connection log data to the
        SUT are stored in the text file <code>qfconnect.log</code>.
      </p>
      
<p>
        The default directory for internal logs is depending on the operating system. The current
        value can be retrieved via the menu
        &raquo;<em>Help</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Info</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>System info</em>&laquo;
        shown as <code>dir.log</code>. The directory can also be explicitly defined via the
        command line argument <a href="tech_execution.html#arg_logdir" shape="rect"><code>-logdir &lt;directory&gt;</code></a>. An invalid directory parameter deactivates internal
        logging.
      </p>
      
<p>
        Here we'd like to emphasize that QF-Test is originally meant as tool for software test
        automation. There we always presume that our customers perform software tests within
        designated test environments with special test data because use of real personal data is not permitted
        according to data protection regulations, following the principles of
        dedication to purpose, minimization of data as well as anonymization.
