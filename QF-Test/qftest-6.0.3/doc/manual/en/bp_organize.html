</h3>

      
<p>
        One of the most challenging tasks in a project is keeping the test-suites maintainable over
        a long period of time. Especially if some window or workflow changes significantly the
        maintenance effort should be kept to a minimum.
      </p>
      
<p>
        It is also worth thinking about how to minimize the creation efforts of tests that contain
        a lot of similar or even the same steps. A typical use-case is launching the SUT or the
        login process or a very important and basic workflow like navigating to a certain part of
        the SUT.
      </p>
      
<p>
        Another aspect to think about is how to efficiently organize test-suites if different
        people work in your testing project.
      </p>
      
<p>
<span class="margin"><a name="new_N97654"></a><span class="note">3.5+</span></span>
        In any case you should create your test-suites within a QF-Test project
        as described in <a href="projects.html#usec_projects">chapter 9</a>. This feature provides
        a better overview over your test-suites and directories.
      </p>
      
<p>
        The following sections show some best practices how to keep your tests maintainable,
        extensible and well-organized.
      </p>

<a href="contents.html#toc_sec_bpOrganizingTests">Organizing tests</a>
</h4>
        
<p>
          In chapter <a href="user_organization.html#usec_testcase">section 8.2</a> we describe the concepts of 'Test-set' and
          'Test-case' nodes. A 'Test-case' node stands for one dedicated test-case and its
          test-data. A typical 'Test-case' could be derived from a use-case, a requirement or a
          defect description in your environment, e.g 'Calculate the price for vehicle xyz at 10%
          discount' for the JCarConfigurator application.
        </p>
        
<p>
          'Test-set' nodes are collections of 'Test-sets' and 'Test-cases' which can be used for
          organizing test-cases, e.g. 'Tests for calculating prices'.
        </p>
        
<p>
          'Test-step' nodes represent the individual test-steps of a 'Test-case' like 'Open window'
          or 'Check calculation'.
        </p>
        
<p>
          If you have an external description of the 'Test-case' or any other associated
          information which might be important for it, it is recommended to add an HTML link to it
          in the 'Comment' attribute of the 'Test-case'. You will see that link in the report
          later. It is even possible to create a separate test documentation using the menu action
          &raquo;<em>File</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Create testdoc documentation</em>&laquo;.
          More details about documentation can be found in <a href="user_report.html#usec_report">chapter 21</a>.
        </p>
        
<p>
<span class="margin"><a name="new_N97733"></a><span class="note">3.1+</span></span>The report and test documentation also contain the
          'Test-step' nodes which are used in a 'Test-case'.
        </p>
        
<p>
          If a 'Test-case' consists of lots of 'Procedure calls' or 'Sequences', you should
          organize the single test-steps in 'Test-step' nodes. Those 'Test-step' nodes have the
          advantage that you can really see every significant step in the QF-Test window and also in
          the report later.
        </p>
        
<p>
          If you want to put several nodes into a 'Test-step' you can pack the respective nodes
          into a 'Test-step' via selecting them, perform a right-mouse click and selecting
          &raquo;<em>Pack nodes</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>TestStep</em>&laquo;.
        </p>

<a href="contents.html#toc_sec_bpModul">Modularization</a>
</h4>
        
<p>
          One of the most important concepts for effective test automation is modularization.
          Modularization here means placing reusable sequences in a dedicated location and calling
          these whenever possible. This concept enables you to create a sequence only once and
          reuse it as often as you require it in your tests without re-recording the same steps
          all the time. Changes in the SUT that require an update of the tests that rely on such a
          sequence, e.g. a change to some basic workflow, can then be handled by updating just the
          procedure in a single location instead of many identical sequences spread all over the
          test-suites.
        </p>
        
<p>
          The modularization concept in QF-Test is implemented via 'Procedure' nodes. Procedures
          are well described in <a href="user_organization.html#usec_procedures">section 8.5</a>.
        </p>
        
<p>
          If you have lots of test cases, it is best to have almost every test-step as a
          'Procedure' and create those procedures up front, if possible. With those procedures in
          place you can fill your test-cases very fast by just adding the respective
          'Procedure call' nodes.
        </p>
        
<p>
          In larger projects it is useful to have 'Procedures' at different level, e.g. component
          specific procedures like 'Click OK' and workflow oriented procedures like 'Create a
          vehicle'.
        </p>

<span class="numtitle"><a href="contents.html#toc_sec_bpParam">33.3</a></span>
</div>
<a href="contents.html#toc_sec_bpParam">Parameterization</a>
</h4>
        
<p>
          The concept of modularization enables you to maintain test-steps at a single location in
          your test-suites. But how to use different test data for different tests?
        </p>
        
<p>
          If you have a 'Procedure' that can be called with different test data, e.g. a typical
          'Login' process with name and password or the 'Select accessory' procedure of the
          JCarConfigurator, you can use variables within the QF-Test nodes. Those variables should be
          used at places where test data is usually being accessed. In most cases variables will
          be used for 'Text input' nodes or for selections of items in a list or a table or
          tree nodes.
        </p>
        
<p>
          If a procedure requires variables you should define the required variables in its list
          of <a href="procedures.html#att_Procedure_variable" shape="rect">'Variable definitions'</a>. This is to ensure that you get a list of all required
          parameters whenever you add a respective 'Procedure call' node for that 'Procedure' to
          your tests. Some customers even set dummy default values for parameters so they can
          recognize immediately when a parameter has not been initialized by the calling test.
        </p>
        
<p>
          The next step is to move those variables from the 'Procedure call' either into the
          <a href="sequences.html#att_TestCase_variable" shape="rect">'Variable definitions'</a> section of the 'Test-case' node or to put the test data into a
          'Data driver' node with a 'Data table' or using an external data source.
        </p>
        
<p>
          The usage of variables and parameters is well described in <a href="user_organization.html#usec_procedures">section 8.5</a>. Parameters can also be created automatically, please see
          <a href="user_organization.html#usec_procedures_Param">subsection 8.5.4</a>. You can find more details about the data driver
          concept for loading test data from a data source in <a href="user_datadriver.html#usec_datadriver">chapter 20</a>.

</h4>
        
<p>
          Up to now you have read about using the modularization and parameterization concept to
          avoid unnecessary and redundant work in the creation process of your tests. You should
          have recognized that those concepts will reduce the maintenance efforts of your
          test-suites by changing or updating only one single sequence instead of several ones.
          But we still do not know how to organize our work for different test engineers or for a
          very large project with a lot of GUI elements.
        </p>
        
<p>
          The answer for an effective working organization comes again from the software
          development area and it is to use several 'libraries' for different areas and different
          responsibilities.
        </p>
        
<p>
          Importing other test-suites into a test-suite enables you to follow that encapsulation
          approach. A typical organization of test-suites in your project could look like this:
        </p>
        
<a name="fig_advBpLibs"></a><a name="figure_33.1"></a>
<table class="figure" cellspacing="0">

</tr>
</table>
        
<p>
          Level 0 is the level that contains test-steps (i.e. 'Procedures') which are required for
          nearly all test-cases in your projects. Such test-steps could be 'Launch SUT' or
          'Perform the login'.
        </p>
        
<p>
          Level 1 contains test-steps for a specific part of the SUT. For the
          JCarConfigurator you can think about a test-suite 'Vehicles' containing 'Procedures'
          like 'Create a vehicle', 'Remove a vehicle' and another test-suite 'Accessories', which
          contains 'Procedures' like 'Create an accessory' or 'Remove an accessory'.
        </p>
        
<p>
          Level 2 is the test-case level. It contains 'Test-cases' and 'Test-sets' for the
          respective area of your software, e.g. 'Tests for vehicle creation' or 'Tests for
          accessory creation'. Of course you could also have a test-suite like 'Integration
          tests' which refers to test-steps from different test-suites at level 1 and level 0.
        </p>
        
<p>
          Level 3 is the so called scenario level. Those test-suites usually just contain
          'Test calls' to level 2 and stand for different scenarios within your test project, e.g.
          'Nightly test scenario', 'Defect verification scenario' or 'Quick-test build
          verification'.
        </p>
        
        
<p>
<span class="margin"><span class="note">Note</span></span>

          The structure described in this document is of course just one possible solution for
          handling test-suites in a project and is not a strict rule you have to follow. You could
          also think about splitting level 1 into a GUI-element level and a workflow level or
          merge level 2 and level 3 to one level. Which structure you finally implement also
          depends on the experience and knowledge of the test-engineers working in your project.
        </p>
        
<p>
          The including area of level 1 test-suites looks like this:

<p>
          Level 0 and level 1 require a good knowledge in working with QF-Test but not a deep
          knowledge of the SUT. On the other hand level 2 and level 3 require a very good
          knowledge of the SUT and the planned test-cases but those engineers usually do not
          require a very deep knowledge of QF-Test as long as they just use procedures from level 0
          and level 1.
        </p>
        
<p>
          Test engineers working in level 0 and level 1 should be capable of implementing scripts
          or control structures like the 'Try'/'Catch' concept which enables them to
          create strong and powerful test libraries. At least the engineers working on level 0,
          but also recommended for engineers working on level 1, should have a good knowledge
          about component recognition in QF-Test. Please see <a href="user_components.html#usec_components">chapter 5</a>,
          <a href="user_subitems.html#usec_subitems">section 5.9</a> and <a href="bp_componentrecognition.html#sec_bpComponentRecognition">section 5.3</a>.

<span class="margin"><span class="note">Note</span></span>

          Even if you are working alone on a project it is strongly recommended to split the tests
          and procedures into different levels because maintenance will become easier than with
          everything kept in one huge test-suite.
        </p>

<a href="contents.html#toc_sec_bpTSHandlingComponents">Managing components at different levels</a>
</h4>
        
<p>
          If you follow the approach suggested in the previous section (<a href="#sec_bpWork">section 33.4</a>) you have to define where the components belong. There are two
          possibilities:
        </p>
        
<ol>
          
<li>Put all components into level 0.</li>
          
<li>Split the components like the procedures into several levels.</li>
        
</ol>
        
<p>
          Storing all components in level 0 is the most simple solution but this could cause you
          to update level 0 very often, just because one single component in your project changes.
          You have to assign responsible persons to keep that structure cleanly.
        </p>
        
<p>
          In big projects you may consider storing the common components like the login dialog or
          the main frame menus, that are important for everyone, in level 0. Components specific
          to a certain area, e.g. a dedicated vehicle dialog, appear only in the test-suite that
          holds the procedures operating on those components.
        </p>
        
<p>
          The workflow for moving components between test-suites is described in <a href="bp_effecientwork.html#sec_bpWorkWithComponents">section 34.4</a> and the workflow for extending existing test-suites is
          described in <a href="bp_effecientwork.html#sec_bpExtendingSuites">section 34.5</a>.

          You don't need to care about <a href="rootnode.html#att_RootStep_dependencies" shape="rect">'Dependencies'</a> of test-suites belonging to a QF-Test project as described in <a href="projects.html#usec_projects">chapter 9</a>, because QF-Test automatically resolves dependent suites. So,
          if you use the concept of projects, you can skip this chapter.
        </p>
        
<p>
          If you work in different test-suites in your project you might sometimes want to rename
          a 'Procedure' or a 'Test-case'. If you do that you may encounter some troubles in
          updating the references to that 'Procedure' or 'Test-case' in other test-suites. If you
          want to keep the other files also being updated after renaming such an element you have
          to maintain the <a href="rootnode.html#att_RootStep_dependencies" shape="rect">'Dependencies'</a> attribute of the root node of the library
          test-suite.

          If you follow the approach described in section <a href="#sec_bpWork">section 33.4</a>, you should
          ensure that level 0 contains a reverse include to level 1, level 1 should contain one to
          level 2 and level 2 should contain another one to level 3. A sample from the provided
          demo test-suites is shown in <a href="#fig_advBpIncludes">figure&nbsp;33.2</a>.
