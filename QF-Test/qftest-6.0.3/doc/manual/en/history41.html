              Selenium WebDriver for Firefox only supports the latest two Firefox versions plus the most recent ESR
              release. At the point of this QF-Test release that means Firefox 51, 52 and 52ESR. We try to improve on that
              as best we can and still support Firefox 38ESR, 45 and higher, but older Firefox versions simply don't run
              as well as current ones. There was a major change for Selenium WebDriver between Firefox 47 and 48 and
              WebDriver based tests run much faster with Firefox 48 upwards. For long-term support we currently
              recommend to use Firefox version 52ESR.

              A major focus for this release is performance, especially for web testing. It has been drastically
              improved for WebDriver mode and JxBrowser and also significantly for web testing in general. The extent of
              some of the effects depends on the actual application and its implementation.

              Thanks to the performance improvements, recording in WebDriver mode has stabilized and should now produce
              the same results as in QF-Driver mode.

              Recording and replay of mouse double clicks is now more intuitive and consistent across all GUI engines.
              In the past, a <a href="events.html#step_MouseEventStep" shape="rect">'Mouse event'</a> node with event type 'Mouse click' and <a href="events.html#att_MouseEventStep_clicks" shape="rect">'Click count'</a> set
              to 2 was shown as a 'Double click' event, even though it was only the second of the two clicks required
              to simulate a double click. Such nodes are now called 'Followup click' and there is a new event type
              'Double click' that properly simulates all the individual events for a complete double click in a single
              node.
            </li>
            
<li>
              

              Test-suites can now be closed by clicking on their tab with the middle mouse button.
            </li>
            
<li>
              

              The procedure <a href="../../../include/qfs_pkgdoc/qfs_pkgdoc.html#qfs.database.executeSelectStatement"><code>qfs.database.executeSelectStatement</code></a> in the QF-Test standard library
              <code>qfs.qft</code> has been improved with respect to the usage of a property group for the result set.
              The group is now cleared before being populated with the current result and the number of records is
              available via the property 'count'.
            </li>
            
<li>
              

              It is now possible to configure fallback values for placeholders in the template file for recording
              procedures.
            </li>
            
<li>
              

              QF-Test now shows the full path to the current test-suite as well as the QF-Test version in the title bar of the
              main window. This can be reduced to just the file name via the option <a href="opt_general.html#opt_showsuitefullpath">Show complete file path and QF-Test version in the title bar</a>.

              WebDriver was updated for the latest Firefox and Chrome versions and QF-Test is now also compatible with the
              version of Microsoft Edge Browser shipped with the upcoming Windows 10 "Creators Update".

<li>
              

              Up to now resolvers were registered globally, applying to all GUI engines, which could lead to unwanted
              side-effects in hybrid applications. By setting the <a href="control.html#att_ClientScriptStep_engine" shape="rect">'GUI engine'</a> attribute in the
              <a href="control.html#step_ClientScriptStep" shape="rect">'SUT script'</a> node that registers the resolver it is now possible to restrict the resolver to the
              desired engine.
            </li>
            
<li>
              

              QF-Test now works around an issue in Jython 2.7 that prevented QF-Test startup in case the user's home directory
              contained international characters.
            </li>
            
<li>
              

              Groovy was updated to version 2.4.8 which fixes a leak of PermGen space in Java 7.
            </li>
            
<li>
              

              When stopping recording too quickly, the last recorded events, checks, components or procedures could get
              lost. Synchronization with the SUT has been improved so that this should now happen only in cases of
              extreme load.
            </li>

<span class="margin"><span class="note">Note</span></span>

              The mechanism for auto-scaling SWT-based UIs on high-DPI monitors is still deactivated by default when
              the SWT plugin is instrumented by QF-Test. The property to re-enable it has been renamed to

              Resolvers are a panacea for all kinds of component recognition problems. To make them easier to write QF-Test
              4.1 introduced an updated <code>resolvers</code> module which is now complemented by a rewrite of
              <a href="tech_resolversmodule.html#sec_nameresolver">subsection 50.1.6</a> which makes resolvers more accessible than ever.
            </li>

              QF-Test did not start if the Java version for QF-Test was still instrumented by an older QF-Test version (pre 4.1).
              Though JRE instrumentation has been deprecated for many years, such a case is still possible. QF-Test now
              detects that situation and helps with deinstrumentation of the JRE.

              When using the <code>databinder.bindList</code> API for performing data-driven testing, QF-Test now ignores

              The error message for expiration of a <a href="tech_execution.html#arg_timeout" shape="rect"><code>-timeout &lt;milliseconds&gt;</code></a> command line argument of a batch call now clearly
              refers to the <code>-timeout &lt;milliseconds&gt;</code> argument instead of the root node of the test-suite.
            </li>
            
<li>
              In large projects editing component IDs in parameter tables no longer causes delays while QF-Test is looking
              for the component to highlight.

<li>
              When searching through a project with an invalid regular expression many errors messages were shown

              If the option <a href="opt_runtime.html#opt_instrumenteventqueue">Instrument AWT EventQueue</a> is active, QF-Test now establishes a connection with
              the awt:security engine in case Java WebStart shows an authentication dialog. Please note that in such a
              case the <a href="processes.html#att_ClientWaiter_engine" shape="rect">'GUI engine'</a> attribute of the <a href="processes.html#step_ClientWaiter" shape="rect">'Wait for client to connect'</a> node must be set to awt:security.

              Auto-detection for AJAX toolkit resolvers has been improved. It now prints concise messages to the
              terminal and cleanly handles the case when no toolkit is detected.

<dt>Jython 2.7</dt>
            
<dd>
              
<p>
		The upgrade to Jython 2.7 was necessary due to conflicts with native libraries in the WebDriver module.
		Besides, Jython 2.5 was quite outdated and the Python modules coming with Jython 2.7 are more
		modern and mature. If the potential issues listed below are causing too much trouble, you can switch
		back to Jython 2.5. To do so, please download the file <a href="https://archive.qfs.de/pub/qftest/jython-2.5.1.jar" shape="rect">https://archive.qfs.de/pub/qftest/jython-2.5.1.jar</a> and use that to replace the file
		<code>lib/jython.jar</code> in QF-Test's installation directory.
              </p>
              
<ul>
		
<li>
		  Java 7 or higher required.
		</li>
		
<li>
		  No support for wildcard import (e.g. <code>from java.util import *</code>), all imported classes need to
		  be listed explicitly.
		</li>
		
<li>
		  You can find more differences between Jython 2.5 and Jython 2.7 in the
		  release notes of Jython 2.6 and Jython 2.7.
		  Please find the release notes of Jython 2.6 at
		  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/2.6.html" shape="rect">https://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/2.6.html</a>

<dt>Groovy 2.4</dt>
            
<dd>
              
<p>
		This upgrade was not strictly necessary, but it is prefereable not to fall too far behind the official
		Groovy Release. Groovy 2.4 still mostly works with Java 6, so the only drawback is if you still need
		support for a legacy application based on Java 5. In that case you can download
		the file <a href="https://archive.qfs.de/pub/qftest/groovy-all-2.1.0.jar" shape="rect">https://archive.qfs.de/pub/qftest/groovy-all-2.1.0.jar</a> and use that to replace the file

<dt>New Swing connection mechanism</dt>
            
<dd>
              This mechanism should be able to handle even very tricky Swing SUTs that implement their own EventQueue,
              especially in combination with WebStart or applets. It is active by default. In case it does cause problems
              with your SUT it can be disabled via the option <a href="opt_runtime.html#opt_instrumenteventqueue">Instrument AWT EventQueue</a>.
            </dd>

            
<dt>Chrome no longer supports Java applets</dt>
	    
<dd>
	      Google has completely dropped support for Java applets in Chrome. This includes the Chrome browser embedded by
	      QF-Test which was updated to CEF version 45.

<p>
            QFS is taking pains to support even very old software. QF-Test should still run, for example, under Windows XP or
            with an SUT based on Java 5 or 6 but for systems that are no longer supported by their own vendors we
            cannot provide full support.
	  </p>
	  
<p>
            Libraries that are required for the Firefox and Eclipse/SWT versions listed below are no longer part of the
            default installation of QF-Test. The majority is still being maintained, albeit with limited testing. For
            Eclipse/SWT 3.5 - 3.8 simply download <a href="https://archive.qfs.de/pub/qftest/swt_legacy.zip" shape="rect">https://archive.qfs.de/pub/qftest/swt_legacy.zip</a> and extract the contents into the <code>swt</code>
            directory of your QF-Test installation. For support of older browsers, please get in touch with QFS via
            <code>support@qfs.de</code>.
	  </p>
	  
<p>
            Official support has been dropped for Java 5, Java 6, Internet Explorer 10 and older, Firefox 37
            and older as well as Eclipse/SWT 3.8 and older.

            </li>
            
<li>
              On macOS QF-Test now uses the standard key bindings for that system. Users that prefer Windows bindings (or
              simply have gotten used to QF-Test's non-Mac bindings) can keep them via the command line argument

            </li>

              When debugging tests, QF-Test now shows a warning when 'Continue execution from here' is attempted on a node
              that is not part of the current execution stack as doing so would lose the current variable bindings.

              Jython was modified to catch and suppress <code>NotImplementedErrors</code> caused by implementing only
              parts of an interface which was OK with Jython 2.5. This behavior can be modified by setting the system
              property <code>qftest.workarounds.abstractMethodsHandling</code> to one of the values "ignore", "warning",

              Uncaught exceptions on the JavaFX application thread were correctly reported by QF-Test, but in some cases
              they were not passed on which might hide bugs in the SUT or at least prevent testing the SUT's own
              handling of uncaught exceptions.

              The new browser connection mode based on Selenium WebDriver adds support for additional browsers including
              Firefox 44 and up, Edge and Safari as well as Chrome now also on Linux and macOS.
            </li>
            
<li>
              Selenium scripts can now be run from inside QF-Test and mixing of QF-Test and Selenium tests is possible. See
              <a href="tech_webdriversutapi.html#sec_webdriversutapi">section 50.12</a> for how to access the WebDriver API from 'SUT script' nodes.

<li>
              QF-Test now officially supports Swing, JavaFX and Web testing on macOS. A dedicated installer is available.
            </li>

              Jython was updated to version 2.7.0. QF-Test now requires at least Java 7 unless Jython is rolled back to

              Support was added for the AJAX framework Kendo UI.
            </li>
            
<li>
              Many existing AJAX resolvers were updated and generalized and are now easier to customize.
              See <a href="tech_ajax.html#sec_ajax">Special support for various web frameworks</a> and <a href="tech_customajax.html#sec_customajax">Improving component recognition with a <code>CustomWebResolver</code></a> for further information.

              In QF-Driver mode QF-Test can now synchronize web tests based on outstanding HTTP requests. This is
              controlled via the options <a href="opt_web.html#opt_webtrackhttprequests">Synchronize with HTTP requests</a>, <a href="opt_web.html#opt_webrequesttimeout">Timeout for HTTP request synchronization (ms)</a> and <a href="opt_web.html#opt_webrequesttimeoutdc">Extended HTTP request timeout for new documents (ms)</a>.

              The new connection mechanism for Swing works out-of-the-box in many of the problematic cases with Java
              WebStart, applets or custom EventQueues. It can be disabled via the option <a href="opt_runtime.html#opt_instrumenteventqueue">Instrument AWT EventQueue</a>.
            </li>
            
<li>
              The maximum execution time for  sequences, test-cases, test-sets or whole batch runs can now be limited
              via the attribute <a href="sequences.html#att_TestCase_exectimeout" shape="rect">'Execution timeout'</a> and the command line argument <a href="tech_execution.html#arg_timeout" shape="rect"><code>-timeout &lt;milliseconds&gt;</code></a>.
            </li>
            
<li>
              Run-logs can now be merged as described in <a href="user_debugging.html#usec_mergerunlogs">Merging run-logs</a>.
            </li>
            
<li>
              Event replay for all engines now uses an approach we call Generic Retry that better handles timing issues,
              especially components that vanish or get replaced just while QF-Test was trying to access them.
            </li>
            
<li>
              Variable expansion is now also possible in a static context so that jumping from a procedure call like
              checksFor${qftest:testcase.name} to the correct procedure simply works. QF-Test caches the most recent
              variable values from the last execution so this is useful even for dynamic bindings.
            </li>
            
<li>
              The various data nodes like <a href="datadriver.html#step_DatabaseDataBinder" shape="rect">'Database'</a> or <a href="datadriver.html#step_ExcelDataBinder" shape="rect">'Excel data file'</a> can now also be executed
              outside a data driver context in order to bind the values directly as variables instead of iterating over
              the sets. In that case the <a href="datadriver.html#att_DatabaseDataBinder_name" shape="rect">'Name'</a> attribute of the node also defines the name of
              the properties group into which the variables are bound.

<li>
              Depending on screen layout it may be preferable to use more space for the tree or for the terminal in
              QF-Test's user interface. The new menu item &raquo;<em>View</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Terminal</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Prefer tree over terminal</em>&laquo; toggles whether tree or
              terminal should occupy the lower left region.
            </li>
            
<li>
              Improved packing of mouse events should result in cleaner recordings with fewer stray events. For special
              cases where individual <code>MOUSE_PRESSED</code> or <code>MOUSE_RELEASED</code> events are preferable, disable the option <a href="opt_record.html#opt_recordmousemprcsimple">Simplified 'Mouse click' recording</a>.

            </li>

            
<li>
              The embedded script editor now supports the keyboard shortcuts [Shift-Up/Down] to move one or more selected lines up or down and , [Shift-Return] to add a new line after the end of the current line.
            </li>

              There is a new toolbar button for opening the most recent run-log.

              Failed boolean checks have a more specific error message that includes the type of check.

              The <code>DOMProcessor</code> extension API now also supports modifying summary documents.

              Script APIs are being unified in preparation for additional scripting languages. Implementing and
              registering resolvers is now easier and more flexible and the autowin and ssh modules are now also
              available in Groovy.

<span class="margin"><a name="web_N210614"></a><span class="note">Web</span></span>

              There is now a generic string check type for DOM node attributes that can be read via
              <code>getAttribute</code>. Simply set the <a href="checks.html#att_CheckStringStep_checktype" shape="rect">'Check type identifier'</a> to <code>attribute:NAME</code>
              where <code>NAME</code> is the name of the attribute to check.
            </li>
            
<li>
              Pressing [Ctrl-C] in the project tree or on the root node of a test-suite
              copies the path of the test-suite to the system clipboard.
            </li>
            
<li>
              Locating references now also works for <a href="procedures.html#step_Package" shape="rect">'Package'</a> nodes. The resulting list contains references to all
              <a href="procedures.html#step_Procedure" shape="rect">'Procedures'</a> in the respective hierarchy.
            </li>
            
<li>
              Pasting nodes in a test-suite is more flexible. If the current location is not suitable for the kind of
              node to be pasted but the target is implicitly clear, the node gets automatically inserted at the correct
              position.

              number of visible rows. The new parameter "countOnlyVisibleNodes" limits the search to visible rows below
              a given node. Also added were procedures <code>...tree.getChildNodeCount</code> with a similar
              functionality and <code>...tree.check.checkChildNodeCount</code> for checking the number or child nodes of
              a node.
