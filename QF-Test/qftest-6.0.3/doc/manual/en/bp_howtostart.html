<p>
        This chapter talks about the most important aspects that should be considered
        <strong>before</strong> you start to use QF-Test widely in your testing project.
        It mostly raises questions and gives general answers with references to more detailed
        information.
      </p>
      
<p>
        The aim of this chapter is to provide hints about issues which you
        should take care of in order to make your GUI tests reliable, stable,
        repeatable and especially maintainable.

</h4>
        
<p>
          Before you start creating and running automated tests you should think about some
          general matters pertaining to the environment where the tests have to run. In order to
          make tests reliable and repeatable you have to take into account that you must be able
          to bring your SUT into a well-defined state, which includes the state of its backend,
          e.g. a server and/or a database. If you do not think about such aspects it might become
          very difficult and sometimes quite tricky to re-run a test or simply to analyze
          test-results and maintenance of tests can become a nightmare.
        </p>
        
<p>
          Please consider the following topics:
        </p>
        
<ol>
          
<li>What is the initial state of your SUT?
            <ul>
              
<li>
                Which user is the actual user running the tests in your SUT? Most projects work
                with dedicated test-users for running tests. Another approach could be to have one
                test-user per test engineer.
              </li>
              
<li>
                Which language setting of your SUT is the primary one? Is it really required to
                reach a full coverage of all supported languages or is it sufficient to run the
                bulk of the tests in one primary language and create only a few tests to
                specifically test localization? In most cases repeating tests in several languages
                just covers the same functionality, so you gain no real new information after
                running them. However, unless you take precautions, the language setting will
                influence the component recognition of QF-Test, please see <a href="bp_componentrecognition.html#sec_bpComponentRecognition">section 5.3</a> for details.
              </li>
            
</ul>
          
</li>
          
<li>What is the initial state of your database?
            <ul>
              
<li>
                Can you work with an extra test database or do you have to use a production
                database? Test databases contain test-data with designed and planned content whereas
                production databases contain real-life data. Is the latter predictable and
                reliable? What about the danger that tests can mess with and possibly destroy
                production data? If at all possible you should avoid running automated tests in a
                production environment.
              </li>
              
<li>
                Can you clean up or reset the environment after one test-run for re-running the
                test? Is it possible to undo changes in the database or is it required to use new
                test-data for the next regression phase?
              </li>
              
<li>
                How can you read or write test-data? Do you want to use standard SQL
                scripts or can you reuse libraries from development? Some projects
                even re-install the whole database before every test-run because they
                cannot reuse any test-data or clean the database correctly.
              </li>
            
</ul>
          
</li>
          
<li>
            Do you want to integrate QF-Test with other tools, e.g. build tools
            or test management tools?
            <ul>
              
<li>
                How to integrate QF-Test with a test management tool? If you can
                reuse already planned test-steps you can avoid redundant work in planning
                tests and creating them. For the standard integration for such tools,
                please see <a href="user_testmanagement.html#usec_testmanagement">chapter 25</a>.
              </li>
              
<li>
                Should test's be launched by a build-tool? If you have created tests you can run
                them unattended and trigger the run by a build-system like Ant or CruiseControl.
                Please see <a href="user_testexecution.html#usec_testexecution">chapter 22</a> for details about test-execution.
              </li>
              
<li>
                Should test-results be uploaded to a reporting system or into a test-management
                system or is it more sufficient to put the HTML reports and run-logs on a
                centralized HTTP-server?
              </li>
            
</ul>
          
</li>
          
<li>Who will work with QF-Test?
          <ul>
            
<li>
                Do only one or two engineers work with QF-Test or do all developers and
                business testers participate in test development? You can find some
                hints about working in a team with different roles in <a href="bp_organize.html#sec_bpRoles">section 33.5</a>.
              </li>
              
<li>
                What are the skills of the engineers? It is recommended to have at
                least one dedicated person with a good QF-Test knowledge in the
                team, who is also capable of implementing scripts and
                understanding software development principles.
              </li>
            
</ul>
          
</li>
        
</ol>
        
<p>
          Of course there will be more issues to take care about which are
          specific for your project. Try to figure them out.
        </p>

</div>
<a href="contents.html#toc_sec_bpLoc">Location of files</a>
</h4>
        
<p>
          You should also think about following aspects of saving or installing files:
        </p>
        
<ol>
          
<li>
            Where to install QF-Test to?

            QF-Test can be installed locally on every system but this forces you to update every
            system manually whenever you need to upgrade to a new version. You can also install
            QF-Test on a shared network drive, if your network is reliable, see <a href="#sec_bpNetworkInstallation">subsection 32.2.1</a> for details.
          </li>
          
<li>
            Where to store the configuration file <code>qftest.cfg</code>?

            Among other things that file contains information about how QF-Test should recognize
            components or what should go into the run-log. These options have to be the same for
            every QF-Test user, otherwise you cannot share tests in your team. To ensure that you can
            either use a shared network installation for QF-Test or specify the config file via
            command-line parameters when launching QF-Test. Make sure the shared config file is
            write-protected unless you explicitly want to change it. For details, see <a href="user_installation.html#usec_configfile">section 1.6</a>.
          </li>
          
<li>
            Where to store the license file <code>license</code>?

            You should put the license file to a central place in order to update the license only
            once when you receive an update for it. Again, you can either have a shared network
            installation for QF-Test or can use command-line parameters to specify the location of
            that file when launching QF-Test. For details, see <a href="user_installation.html#usec_licensefile">section 1.5</a>.
          </li>
          
<li>
            Where to store the test-suites?

            The best place to store test-suites is a version management system where you can
            track the changes and access any version of the files. If this is not possible you
            should store them on a shared network drive.
          </li>
          
<li>
            Where to store the test data files?

            Test data files are associated with test-suites so you should store them closely to
            the suites, i.e. either in the same version management system or on a shared network
            drive.
          </li>
          
<li>
            Where to store the HTML reports and run-logs?

            You should put those files in a centralized place where any engineer can take a look
            at them to evaluate the tests-results. Most people tend to use an HTTP server or a
            shared network drive for that.
          </li>
        
</ol>

<a href="contents.html#toc_sec_bpNetworkInstallation">Network installation</a>
</h5>
          
<p>
            If you plan to install QF-Test on a shared network drive you have to take care about some
            specific things.
          </p>
          
<p>
            The main source of conflict is the system settings file <code>qftest.cfg</code>. It is
            actually a good (and necessary) thing to have all users use the same system settings,
            especially for the recognition options. Sharing the system settings file facilitates
            this. However, this file should be made read-only so that one user will not
            inadvertently change the system settings for everyone. If the file is read-only, QF-Test
            will not save the system settings upon exit. Any change to these settings will have
            to be made by explicitly making that file writable, then exiting QF-Test and then making
            it read-only again. Alternatively each user could specify a different system settings
            file via <a href="tech_execution.html#arg_systemcfg" shape="rect"><code>-systemcfg &lt;file&gt;</code></a> but that's not advisable.
          </p>
          
          
<p>
            The running QF-Test instances will also share the log directory (internal logging, not a
            problem) and the Jython package cache which can occasionally cause problems so that QF-Test
            cannot initialize its Jython interpreter. This doesn't happen often and can be fixed
            by clearing (not removing) the Jython cachedir.
          </p>
          
<p>
            For Windows, each user should also execute the <code>setup.exe</code> for the primary
            QF-Test version, located in the installed qftest-x.y.z directory, to get proper registry
            settings and documentation links on his machine.
          </p>
          
<p>
            In the rare case when a QF-Test patch overwrites existing jar files of QF-Test, running
            instances based on those jars may crash on Windows.
          </p>

<a href="contents.html#toc_sec_bpComponentRec">Component Recognition</a>
</h4>
        
<p>
          The most important aspect of a GUI testing tool is a stable and reliable recognition of
          the graphical components. In that area QF-Test is very flexible and can be configured in
          several ways. In most cases the default configuration for the component recognition works
          well, but sometimes you may have to change it.
        </p>
        
<p>
          If you change the component recognition options after creating lots of test-cases, those
          test-cases may break. Therefore you should try to find the most appropriate settings for
          your project as early as possible. It is worth spending time in that area before
          starting to implement a huge amount of tests because in the worst case you might have to
          re-record or at least update all or most of the existing test-cases after a critical
          change of the recognition options.
        </p>
        
<p>
          Best start by recording some demo test-cases and figure out how QF-Test recognizes your
          SUT's components. The recognition mechanism is described in <a href="user_components.html#usec_components">chapter 5</a> and <a href="user_subitems.html#usec_subitems">section 5.9</a>. If you re-run those demo
          test-cases - ideally on different versions of your SUT - and run into recognition
          problems, you have to ask yourself following questions about those tests:
        </p>
        
<ol>
          
<li>
            Are there enough synchronization points, like 'Wait for component to appear' or 'Check' nodes
            with timeouts to execute test-steps only if the SUT is ready for them?
            <ol>
              
<li>
                Sample 1: After opening a window you can only work in that window, if it is really
                there -&gt; Use a 'Wait for component to appear' node.
              </li>
              
<li>
                Sample 2: After pressing on a search button, you can only continue with the test
                when the search is really over -&gt; Use a 'Check' node with a timeout.
              </li>
            
</ol>
          
</li>
        
</ol>
        
<p>
          Another important aspect besides synchronization points is the correct approach of
          recognizing components. You have to ask yourself the following questions to determine,
          which recognition approach might be the most appropriate one:
        </p>
        
<ol>
          
<li>
            Do the developers use unique and stable names for their components? Please take a
            closer look at <a href="components.html#sec_windows">section 38.13</a>.
          </li>
          
<li>
            Perhaps it is sufficient to use a regular-expression for the 'Feature' attribute of
            the component of the main window under the 'Windows and components' node. Please see
            <a href="usec_components_feature.html#sec_bpCRRegex">subsection 5.4.3.1</a> for details.
          </li>
          
<li>
            If development did not set useful or even dynamic names it may be required to
            implement a NameResolver. Please take a closer look at <a href="bp_componentrecognition.html#sec_bpComponentRecognition">section 5.3</a>.
          </li>
          
<li>
            Do any of the QF-Test recognition options need to be changed? These are described in
            <a href="bp_componentrecognition.html#sec_bpComponentRecognition">section 5.3</a>.
          </li>
          
<li>
            Is it possible to use generic components? See <a href="sec_bpCRGeneric.html#sec_bpCRGeneric">section 5.8</a> for
            details.
          </li>
        
</ol>
        
<p>
          In some cases it is sufficient to change the default configuration. Let us assume the
          developers have set unique and stable names for the target components, i.e. buttons,
          textfields, checkboxes etc. In such cases it may be sufficient to just change the
          'Name override mode' setting of QF-Test to 'Name overrides everything'. This setting tells
          QF-Test to ignore any changes in the component hierarchy and just work with the target
          components and the window directly.
        </p>
        
<p>
          
<span class="margin"><span class="note">Note</span></span>

          You have to change this option in two places: Once at 'Record' -&gt; 'Components' -&gt; 'Name
          override mode' and at 'Replay' -&gt; 'Recognition' -&gt; 'Name override mode'. See <a href="bp_componentrecognition.html#sec_bpComponentRecognition">section 5.3</a> for more details.
        </p>
