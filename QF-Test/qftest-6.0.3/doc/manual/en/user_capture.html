        &raquo;<em>Record</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Pause</em>&laquo; or the pause button <img src="../icons/pause_tb.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom" alt="Pause recording" title="Pause recording" width="26" height="26" texscale=".66"> if you need to execute some
        steps in the SUT that should not be recorded and you don't want to
        stop and restart the recording.
      </p>
      
<p>
        Recording mode can be started and stopped directly in the SUT by use of the <a href="opt_record.html#opt_hotkeyrecord">Hotkey for recording</a>.
        Default key is [F11].

<p>
        Any <a href="components.html#step_ComponentStep" shape="rect">'Components'</a> referred to by the newly recorded events are
        added automatically to the <a href="components.html#step_WindowList" shape="rect">'Windows and components'</a> node if they are not there
        already.
      </p>
      
<p>
        There are many options that influence the way QF-Test records events
        and how it treats the components of the GUI. All of these are explained
        in detail in <a href="opt_record.html#sec_opt_record">section 37.2</a> of the reference
        manual. Once you are familiar with QF-Test you should take the time to
        skim through it.
      </p>
      
<p>
        Here's some general advice for recording:
      </p>
      
<ul>
        
<li>
          Record short sequences at a time.
        </li>
        
<li>
          After recording, take a look at the sequence, try to understand
          what you got and whether it represents the actions you took.
        </li>
        
<li>
          Edit the sequence to remove unnecessary events, especially those at
          the beginning and end caused by switching windows. QF-Test has
          excellent filters that should catch nearly all of these, but some
          might remain and have to be removed manually.
        </li>
        
<li>
          Finally, try out the new sequence to see whether it replays OK. Then
          you can cut/copy/paste as needed to integrate it into larger parts.
        </li>
      
</ul>
      
<p>
        
<span class="margin"><a name="mac_N69209"></a><span class="note">Mac</span></span>For SUT's running on macOS QF-Test disables use of the screen menu bar and
        activates normal menu bar behavior like on other platforms.
        This is due to the fact that QF-Test cannot fully access the screen menu
        bar which prevents proper capture/replay of menu actions. In case the typical Mac screen
        menu bar behavior is necessary for any reason, this can be forced by adding the line
        <code>qfs.apple.noScreenMenuBar=false</code> to the file <code>qfconnect.properties</code> that
        is located in QF-Test's root directory. After restarting the SUT the screen menu bar is
        supposed to work as normal on Mac.

<p>
        To run some tests, select the node or nodes to execute and press
        [Return] or the
        play button <img src="../icons/play_tb.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom" alt="Play" title="Play" width="26" height="26" texscale=".66"> or select
        &raquo;<em>Run</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Start</em>&laquo;. QF-Test will mark each node with a
        small arrow as it is executed and also show progress messages in the
        status bar. This can slow down execution a little and can be turned
        off with the options <a href="opt_play.html#opt_markrunningsteps">Mark nodes during replay</a> and
        <a href="opt_play.html#opt_printrunningsteps">Show replay messages in status line</a>.
      </p>
      
<p>
        When the test is finished, the result is shown in the status bar. If
        things are fine you should see "No errors", otherwise the number of
        warnings, errors and exceptions is shown. Additionally, a message
        dialog is shown in case of errors or exceptions to make sure you don't
        miss these.
      </p>
      
<p>
        As for recording there are many options that influence the replay of
        tests. Some of these are only for convenience while others have a
        major impact on the outcome of the tests. Be sure to read <a href="opt_play.html#sec_opt_play">section 37.3</a> some time to familiarize yourself with these.
      </p>
      
<p>
        To abort execution before the test is finished, press the stop button
        <img src="../icons/stop_tb.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom" alt="Stop" title="Stop" width="26" height="26" texscale=".66"> or select &raquo;<em>Run</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Stop</em>&laquo;. You can also
        suspend execution temporarily via the pause button <img src="../icons/pause_tb.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom" alt="Pause" title="Pause" width="26" height="26" texscale=".66"> or by selecting &raquo;<em>Run</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Pause</em>&laquo;. This will
        also enable the debugger (see <a href="user_debugging.html#usec_debugging">chapter 7</a>). To
        continue, press pause again.
      </p>
      
<p>
        While a test is run at full speed it can be tricky to stop or
        interrupt it, especially when the mouse cursor is actually moved
        across the screen or the SUT's windows are raised on every event.
        To regain control, press the <a href="opt_play.html#opt_panickey">(Don't) Panic key</a> (the
        default is [Alt-F12]). This
        will pause all running tests immediately. To continue, press the same
        combination again.
      </p>
      
<p>
        While building a test-suite you will often want to execute some
        sequences to get the SUT to a point where you can continue
        recording. Sometimes you may want to skip certain nodes at this stage
        because they don't get you where you want, but you don't want to
        delete them or move them to some other place. In that case use the
        &raquo;<em>Edit</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Toggle&nbsp;disabled&nbsp;state</em>&laquo; menu item to disable the node(s). When you want to use
        them again later you can re-enable them.
      </p>
      
<p>
        The current error state during replay as well as the final result is shown in the status
        line at the bottom of the QF-Test main window. The visibility of this status line can be
        controlled via &raquo;<em>View</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Show status         line</em>&laquo;.
      </p>
      
<p>
        In case <a href="sequences.html#step_TestSet" shape="rect">'Test-set'</a> or <a href="sequences.html#step_TestCase" shape="rect">'Test-case'</a> nodes (<a href="user_organization.html#usec_testcase">section 8.2</a> describes

</h4>
      
<p>
        Though it can be quite entertaining to record sequences and watch the
        magic dance of the SUT as they are played back, the task at hand is
        to find out whether the SUT actually works as expected. This is
        where <a href="checks.html#sec_checks" shape="rect">checks</a> come into play. The most common
        check, the <a href="checks.html#step_CheckStringStep" shape="rect">'Check text'</a> node, reads the text displayed by a
        component, e.g. a text field, and compares it to a given value. If the
        values differ, an error is signaled.
      </p>
      
<p>
        How checks work is explained in detail in the <a href="checks.html#sec_checks" shape="rect">Reference manual</a>.
        There is a range available from simple text check to advance <a href="checks.html#step_CheckImageStep" shape="rect">'Check image'</a> and even
        <a href="tech_checkers.html#sec_checkers">custom check types</a> can be implemented.
        Here we are going to concentrate on the most convenient way to create checks, which is to
        record them.
      </p>
      
<p>
        While recording, the SUT is in <em>record mode</em>, which means
        that all events are collected and sent to QF-Test. With the help of the
        check button <img src="../icons/check_tb.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom" alt="Check" title="Check" width="26" height="26" texscale=".66"> or by selecting
        &raquo;<em>Record</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Check</em>&laquo; you can bring it into <em>check mode</em>,
        recognizable through the different mouse cursor. In this mode,
        recording events is suspended. Instead, the mouse cursor is tracked
        and the component under it is highlighted. When you click on the
        component, a check for the component is recorded using the value that
        is currently displayed. To get back to record mode, select the check
        button or menu item again.
      </p>
      
<p>
        There are different kinds of <a href="checks.html#sec_checks" shape="rect">checks</a> that can be performed. Which kinds
        of checks are applicable depends on the selected component. Some
        components don't display any text, so a <a href="checks.html#step_CheckStringStep" shape="rect">'Check text'</a> node
        doesn't make sense for, say, a scroll bar. Clicking on a component
        with the right mouse button while in check mode brings up a menu of
        applicable checks for this component. Select one of the items to
        create the respective check node. Clicking with the left mouse button
        always records the default check, which is the topmost one in the
        popup menu.
      </p>
      
<p>
        If you hold down the [Shift] or [Ctrl] key while clicking with the right mouse button, the
        check menu will stay open after making a selection. That way, you can
        easily record multiple kinds of checks for the same component.
      </p>
      
<p>
        Checks integrate well with events and you'll soon develop a recording
        style a'la <em>click, click, type, click, check, click, click,
        check...</em> Having to switch back and forth between QF-Test and the
        SUT every time you want to create a check can be a real pain. That
        is where the <a href="opt_record.html#opt_hotkeycheck">Hotkey for checks</a> option comes into
        play. It defines a key which toggles the SUT between record mode and
        check mode. The default value is [F12], but if
        this key has some defined meaning for your application you can change
        it to whatever you like. To record a sequence of interspersed events
        and checks, simply start recording, switch to the SUT and record the
        sequence. Whenever you want to add some checks, just press
        [F12] (or whatever you defined), record the
        checks, then switch back to record mode by pressing [F12] again and continue. This way you can work with the SUT
        for the whole sequence and need to switch back to QF-Test only to stop
        the recording.
      </p>
      
<p>
        One word of warning should be repeated: Don't let this convenience
        tempt you into recording extremely long sequences. When something
        changes that causes such a sequence to fail you will be hard put to
        find out what went wrong and how to cope.

<p>
        As already described component information is automatically stored when recording events
        or checks. Nevertheless there are situations where capturing of just components proves
        useful.
      </p>
      
<p>
        To activate <em>component recording mode</em> you simply need to press the record
        components button <img src="../icons/component_tb.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom" alt="Record         components" title="Record components" width="26" height="26" texscale=".66"> or select
        &raquo;<em>Record</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Record components</em>&laquo; from
        the menu. Then switch to the SUT window where you will notice a special behavior in
        which the component below the mouse cursor is highlighted.
      </p>
      
<p>
        Clicking with the left mouse button on a component will record the single component while
        pushing the right button instead will pop up a menu with choices to record the nested
        components as well or all components in the window. Multiple components can be captured in
        this way. Then switch back to QF-Test and release the record components button <img src="../icons/component_tb.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom" title="Record components" width="26" height="26" texscale=".66"> or deactivate &raquo;<em>Record</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Record components</em>&laquo;. Now the recorded component information is
        stored in shape of respective <a href="components.html#step_ComponentStep" shape="rect">'Component'</a> nodes under the <a href="components.html#step_WindowList" shape="rect">'Windows and components'</a> node.
      </p>
      
<p>
        Component recording mode can be alternatively controlled by a configurable hotkey. Default
        binding is [F11], the option that configures it is <a href="opt_record.html#opt_hotkeycomponent">Hotkey for components</a>.
      </p>
      
<p>
        Pressing [F11] (default setting) <em>in the SUT window</em> starts
        component recording. Further details can be found in the documentation for the option
        <a href="opt_record.html#opt_hotkeycomponent">Hotkey for components</a>.
      </p>
      
<p>
        
<span class="margin"><span class="note">Note</span></span> Only one test-suite at a time can receive the recorded components. If more
        than one test-suite is open and each is shown in an individual window, i.e. workbench mode
        is deactivated, either the test-suite in which the recording is stopped (toolbar button or
        menu) or - when using [F11], the test-suite that can be selected via
        the menu item
        &raquo;<em>Record</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Suite is receiver for recording</em>&laquo;
        will receive the components.
      </p>
      
<p>
        The component recording feature can also be used to quickly locate a component
        independent of whether it has been recorded before. When creating
        event or checks by hand or changing the target component, the
        <a href="events.html#att_MouseEventStep_component" shape="rect">'QF-Test component ID'</a> attribute needs to be specified. When a
        component is recorded, its
        'QF-Test ID' is saved in the clipboard and can be pasted directly into the
        'QF-Test component ID' field with [Ctrl-V]. You can also jump directly to the 'Component' node with
        [Shift-Ctrl-Backspace] or by choosing
        the
        &raquo;<em>Edit</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Select next node</em>&laquo;
        menu item or clicking the respective toolbar button.
      </p>
      
<p>
        The context menu which appears when clicking with the right mouse button on a component
        also contains an entry &raquo;<em>Show methods</em>&laquo; which allows of some kind of
        component inspection (see <a href="user_componentinspection.html#usec_componentinspection">section 5.12</a>).
      </p>
      
<p>
        Components play a central role in the structure of a test-suite which is explained
        further in <a href="user_components.html#usec_components">chapter 5</a>.

</div>
<a href="contents.html#toc_usec_requestrecording">Recording of HTTP requests (GET/POST)</a>
</h4>
      
<p>
        In order to record a (GET/POST) request sent by the SUT, the SUT must have been launched from QF-Test
        (see <a href="user_quickstart.html#usec_quickstart">chapter 3</a>) and the connection between QF-Test and the SUT must be
        established.
      </p>
      
<p>
        While recording, the SUT is in <em>record mode</em>, which means
        that all events are collected and sent to QF-Test. With the help of the
        HTTP-request button <img src="../icons/request_tb.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom" alt="Record HTTP Requests" title="Record HTTP Requests" width="26" height="26" texscale=".66"> or by selecting
        &raquo;<em>Record</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Record HTTP Requests</em>&laquo; you can bring it into <em>request recording mode</em>.
        In contrast to <a href="#usec_recording" shape="rect">Recording sequences</a> all GET/POST-request send by the web
        browser are saved as http-request nodes in this special recording mode.
        To get back to record mode, select the HTTP-request button or menu item again.
      </p>
      
<p>
         In section <a href="opt_web.html#sec_opt_web" shape="rect">Web options</a> the ability to change the type of the recorded request
         is described. By default <a href="requests.html#step_ClientRequestStep" shape="rect">'Browser HTTP request'</a> is recorded. This Request type is likely used to automate
         large web form inputs, the use of separate input nodes will be avoided. The form data will be submitted
         within the browser, so that the response will be shown as well. At this point the test execution could be
         continued.  In opposition to this the <a href="requests.html#step_RequestStep" shape="rect">'Server HTTP request'</a> will be directly submitted through QF-Test without
         the need of a  running browser. The response is also only available in QF-Test and a eventually running
         browser will not be affected.
      </p>
      
<p>
         All attributes of an accordingly recorded request node as well as the parametrization of requests are
         explained in detail in the <a href="requests.html#sec_requests" shape="rect">HTTP Requests</a> section of the reference part
         of this manual.
