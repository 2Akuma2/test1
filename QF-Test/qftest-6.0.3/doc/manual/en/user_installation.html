      The installation of QF-Test on the supported operating systems is explained in detail in the subsequent sections.
      The following packages are available for download:
    </p>
    
<dl>
      
<dt>Windows (<a href="#usec_install_windows">section 1.2</a>)</dt>
      
<dd>
        On Windows QF-Test is normally installed via the setup program <code>QF-Test-6.0.3.exe</code> which
        requires administrator privileges. If you are lacking the required permissions or prefer to keep all QF-Test
        files together in one place you can unpack the self-extracting archive
        <code>QF-Test-6.0.3-sfx.exe</code> instead.
      </dd>
      
<dt>Linux / Unix (<a href="#usec_install_unix">section 1.3</a>)</dt>
      
<dd>
        On Linux and other Unix systems please unpack the archive <code>QF-Test-6.0.3.tar.gz</code>.
      </dd>
      
<dt>macOS (<a href="#usec_install_macos">section 1.4</a>)</dt>
      
<dd>
        The disk-image <code>QF-Test-6.0.3.dmg</code> is provided for the installation on macOS.
      </dd>
    
</dl>
    
<p>
      It is possible to have different versions of QF-Test installed in
      parallel. Existing configuration files will not be overwritten during setup.
    </p>
    
<p>
      In <a href="bp_howtostart.html#sec_bpLoc">section 32.2</a> you can find best practices about the QF-Test installation.

          QF-Test itself requires Java 8 or Java 17. A 64 bit Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is provided with QF-Test, so
          Java does not need to be installed on your system unless required by the SUT.
        </p>
        
<p>
          
<span class="margin"><span class="note">Note</span></span>
          If your system under test (SUT) uses Java it should typically use its own JRE, not that of QF-Test. The Java
          command for the SUT can be configured separately when creating the setup sequence for your SUT.
          Supported Java versions for the SUT are listed below.
        </p>
        
<p>
          For a QF-Test installation you need to reserve about 1 GB on your hard disk. The required
          RAM to work with QF-Test is in the same region but depends on the sizes of your
          test-suites and the length of your test-run, see <a href="faq.html#faq_memory">
      I've got a long-running test and QF-Test runs out of memory. How can I prevent that?
    </a>. Note
          that you need to add the resources required by the SUT.

</h5>
        
<p>
          This setup requires administrator privileges and follows the Windows standard of separating read-only
          program files from writable configuration files. If an older QF-Test version is detected it is also possible to
          skirt Windows standards and install QF-Test and its system configuration together at the place of the old
          installation.
        </p>

<span class="margin"><a name="new_N66354"></a><span class="note">4.2+</span></span>
          <strong>Windows compliant installation</strong>
<br>

          Program files are saved to <code>C:\Program Files\QFS\QF-Test</code> or whichever target directory you
          choose. The system configuration with writable data is stored in <code>%PROGRAMDATA%\QFS\QF-Test</code>,
          irrespective of the selected target directory.
        </p>
        
<p>
          
<span class="margin"><span class="note">Note</span></span>

          <code>%PROGRAMDATA%</code> usually refers to the directory <code>C:\ProgramData</code> but the name may vary
          depending on the Windows system. By default is is hidden in Windows Explorer. A simple way to navigate to
          this directory is to enter <code>%PROGRAMDATA%</code> into the address bar of Windows Explorer. In a
          PowerShell window use <code>cd $env:PROGRAMDATA</code>, in a cmd console window <code>cd /d
          %PROGRAMDATA%</code> to change to the respective drive and directory.
        </p>

        
<p>
          
<span class="margin"><a name="new_N66390"></a><span class="note">4.2+</span></span>
          <strong>Installation together with an existing QF-Test version</strong>
<br>

          If an older QF-Test installation is found and there is no system configuration in
          <code>%PROGRAMDATA%\QFS\QF-Test</code> yet, you choose to follow the Windows compliant installation using
          <code>%PROGRAMDATA%</code> or to stick with the existing structure and install QF-Test there.
        </p>
        
<p>
          In the first case, after selecting the target directory for the QF-Test program files, the system configuration
          files are copied - just this once - from the existing installation to
          <code>%PROGRAMDATA%\QFS\QF-Test</code>.
        </p>
        
<p>
          When installing into the existing structure, QF-Test is installed into that directory and shares the system
          configuration that is already present there.
        </p>
        
<p>
          In both cases the directory <code>%PROGRAMDATA%\QFS\QF-Test\qftestpath</code> is added to the system PATH and
          the program files qftest.exe and qftestc.exe are copied there. This allows to start QF-Test from anywhere.
        </p>
        
<p>
          Independent of the installation choice both old and new QF-Test can be run in parallel. In case of the Windows
          compliant installation with <code>%PROGRAMDATA%</code> the old and new system configuration are independent.
          If the old structure is kept, all versions share the same system configuration. In the medium to long term
          we advise to move to <code>%PROGRAMDATA%</code> because the old structure requires changing access rights in
          the program directory, which is questionable. However, while migrating tests from QF-Test 4.1 to 4.2 it may be
          convenient to keep both versions close together. The move to a Windows compliant installation using
          <code>%PROGRAMDATA%</code> can also be made in the course of a later installation.
        </p>
        
<p>
          
<strong>Silent Installation</strong>
<br>
          For an automatic distribution on test systems it might be necessary to install QF-Test silently. QF-Test supports this kind of installation
          because the installer is based on Inno Setup. This allows to use nearly all documented parameters from
          <a href="https://jrsoftware.org/ishelp/index.php?topic=setupcmdline" shape="rect">https://jrsoftware.org/ishelp/index.php?topic=setupcmdline</a>
          at the installation of QF-Test.
        </p>
        
<p>
          You can perform a silent default installation with <code>QF-Test-6.0.3.exe /VERYSILENT</code>.<br>
          If you want to not create a Deskop icon you can run <code>QF-Test-6.0.3.exe /VERYSILENT /MERGETASKS="!desktopicon"</code>.
          This executes a standard installation without the task "desktopicon".<br>
          Both the <code>minisetup-admin.exe</code> and <code>minisetup-noadmin.exe</code> can also be installed silently.
          For example via <code>minisetup-admin.exe /VERYSILENT</code>.
        </p>
        
<p>
          Please note that the installation for all users always requires elevated administrative rights.
          To also automatically accept the Windows UAC dialog the calling process must already have elevated rights.
          The parameter <code>/CURRENTUSER</code> does not help here, because the installation always requires elevated rights independent of installing for all
          or just the current user.<br>
          An exception of this rule is <code>minisetup-noadmin.exe</code>, which allows to configure an already installed QF-Test for the current user only.
          It does not need elevated rights.
        </p>
        
<p>
          Instead of performing a silent installation you can also use the portable self-extracting archive <code>QF-Test-6.0.3-sfx.exe</code>.
        </p>

          If you don't have administrator privileges or want to keep all QF-Test files together in a single place, unpack

          archive to open and extract it with 7-Zip. This will create a directory named <code>qftest</code> at the
          target location which we will refer to as the root directory of QF-Test and that will also hold QF-Test's system
          configuration files.
        </p>
        
<p>
          After unpacking the files you can run the program <code>minisetup-noadmin.exe</code> in the sub-directory
          <code>qftest-6.0.3</code>. It will create associations for the file extensions belonging to QF-Test
          and optionally a startup menu entry and a desktop icon for QF-Test. If you have administrator privileges you
          can run <code>minisetup-admin.exe</code> instead which applies the same settings for all users and also
          adds the directory <code>%PROGRAMDATA%\QFS\QF-Test\qftestpath</code> to the system PATH and copies the
          program files <code>qftest.exe</code> and <code>qftestc.exe</code> there.
        </p>
        
<p>
          If you'd rather have a fully portable installation instead, you can create a folder named
          <code>userdir</code> in the <code>qftest</code> directory which will then serve as the user-specific
          configuration directory in place of
          <code>%APPDATA%\QFS\QF-Test</code> so that really all files belonging to QF-Test are kept together in one place
          and no changes are made to the system.
        </p>

</h5>
        
<p>
          As the last step each of the setup programs will offer to configure the Java program for QF-Test which is
          done with the help of a small dialog in which you can make your choices. With a portable installation you
          can run the program <code>qftest\qftest-6.0.3\bin\qfconfig.exe</code> to achieve the same.
        </p>
        
<p>
          
<span class="margin"><a name="new_N66569"></a><span class="note">4.2+</span></span>

          A 64 bit Java Runtime Environment is installed with QF-Test into its installation folder. It is recommended to
          use it. On a 32 bit Windows machine you must provide a Java 8 JDK or JRE yourself. You can either copy a 32
          bit JRE 8 into QF-Test's installation directory as <code>...\qftest-6.0.3\jre\win32</code> and also
          chose to use the QF-Test Java or you can install it as the system JRE or in any other convenient place and
          select that as the alternative Java program.
        </p>
        
<p>
          The dialog also lets you adjust the maximum amount of memory to be used by
          QF-Test with a default of 1024 MB.
        </p>
        
<p>
          The third value to be configured is the language for
          QF-Test. Normally the language is determined by the system
          settings, but you can also choose to always use the English or
          the German version.
        </p>
        
<p>
          The values above are stored in the file <code>launcherwin.cfg</code> in QF-Test's system configuration
          directory from where they are read by the <code>qftest.exe</code> start program. You can run the
          configuration program any time from the system menu to change these settings.
        </p>

</div>
<a href="contents.html#toc_usec_install_unix">Linux/Unix Installation</a>
</h4>
      
<p>
        First select a convenient directory that will contain this release of
        QF-Test as well as future updates. Common choices are
        <code>/opt</code> or <code>/usr/local</code>. Make sure you have
        write access to this directory and change to it. When upgrading to a
        new QF-Test version, use the same directory again.
      </p>
      
<p>
        Unpack the <code>.tar.gz</code> archive
        with <code>tar xfzv QF-Test-6.0.3.tar.gz</code>.  This will
        create a directory named <code>qftest</code>, which we will refer to
        as the main or root directory of QF-Test. On a Linux/Unix system this also serves as the system
        directory holding the system configuration files of QF-Test.
      </p>
      
<p>
        After unpacking a QF-Test archive for the first time, QF-Test's
        root directory will hold only the version-specific subdirectory
        <code>qftest-6.0.3</code>. When upgrading, a new
        subdirectory for the current version will be added.
      </p>
      
<p>
        To finish the installation, change to the specific directory for the current QF-Test version
        with <code>cd qftest/qftest-6.0.3</code> and run the setup script
        provided (<code>setup.sh</code>).
      </p>
      
<p>
        The setup script will create the directories <code>log</code>,
        <code>jython</code> <code>groovy</code> and <code>javascript</code> under QF-Test's root directory unless they
        already exist. Additionally it will offer to create a symbolic link
        from the <code>/usr/local/bin</code> directory (or
        <code>/usr/bin</code> if there is no <code>/usr/local/bin</code>) to
        the shell run script for the <code>qftest</code> command.
        You need to have write permission to the <code>/usr/local/bin</code>
        directory for the link to be created.
      </p>
      
<p>
        On Linux QF-Test should normally use its own JRE. Alternatively
        the default <code>java</code> program for QF-Test can be defined now.
        Either way it can be overridden at execution time with the <a href="tech_execution.html#arg_java" shape="rect"><code>-java &lt;executable&gt;</code></a>
        argument.  The setup script searches <code>PATH</code> and proposes
        to use the first <code>java</code> program it detects. If you want to
        use a different <code>program</code> or if none was found, you can
        enter one. The script determines the JDK version automatically.
      </p>
      
<p>
        Next setting to perform is the maximum amount of memory to be used by QF-Test. As default
        1024 MB are taken. Alternatively QF-Test can be started with the <code>-J-XmxZZZm</code>
        command line argument, where <code>ZZZ</code> defines the memory in MB.
      </p>
      
<p>
        Finally the language for QF-Test can be configured. By default the
        language depends on the system settings, but you can also choose to
        always use the English or the German version. Note that this setting
        will affect all QF-Test users. Alternatively you can run QF-Test
        with the <code>-J-Duser.language=XX</code> option using
        <code>en</code> for English or <code>de</code> for German.
      </p>
      
<p>
        Those of the above settings that differ from the default are written to the file
        <code>launcher.cfg</code> in QF-Test's root directory. This file is read by the
        <code>qftest</code> launch-script and also evaluated during an update of QF-Test.
      </p>

        QF-Test requires a license file to run, which you should have
        received from Quality First Software GmbH.

<p>
        
<span class="margin"><a name="new_N66800"></a><span class="note">4.0+</span></span> Since QF-Test 4.0 the preferred way to activate or update your QF-Test
        license is by way of the menu
        &raquo;<em>Help</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Update license...</em>&laquo;.<br>
        The traditional way as described below is also still valid.
      </p>
      
<p>
        Place the license file into the system directory of QF-Test. On Windows, depending on the type of installation,
        this will be <code>%PROGRAMDATA%\QFS\QF-Test</code> (see <a href="#usec_install_windows">section 1.2</a>) or the root
        directory of your QF-Test installation as on Linux. Make sure the file is named <code>license</code> <strong>with
        no extension</strong>. Some mail clients try to guess the file type and add an extension on their own. When
        upgrading to a new QF-Test version you can simply keep the license file provided that it is valid for the new
        version.
      </p>

        and select the "System info" tab.
      </p>
      
<p>
        If you need to upgrade your license, for example to increase the
        number of concurrent QF-Test instances or when upgrading to a new
        version, you will receive a file called <code>license.new</code> from
        Quality First Software GmbH which is typically not a valid license in itself but must be
        combined with your current license. To do so, proceed as follows:
      </p>
      
<ul>
        
<li>
          Place the file <code>license.new</code> in the same directory as the
          current license. Make sure that this directory and the file
          <code>license</code> are writable by you.
        </li>
        
<li>
          Start QF-Test in interactive mode. QF-Test will detect the license update,
          verify its validity and offer to upgrade your license file.
        </li>
        
<li>
          If you agree, the current license will be renamed to
          <code>license.old</code> and the new, combined license will be
          written to <code>license</code>. When you are satisfied that
          everything is OK, you can remove the files <code>license.old</code>
          and <code>license.new</code>.
        </li>
        
<li>
          If QF-Test doesn't seem to recognize the license upgrade, make sure
          that the timestamp of the file <code>license.new</code> is newer
          than that of the file <code>license</code>. Also make sure that no
          other instance of QF-Test is running on your computer.
        </li>
      
</ul>
      
<p>
        In case you need to specify a special name or location for the license file or work
        with more than one license, this can be achieved with help of the <a href="tech_execution.html#arg_license" shape="rect"><code>-license &lt;file&gt;</code></a>

        QF-Test saves all of its window configuration and those global
        options that represent personal preferences together in a file
        named <code>config</code> located in the QF-Test user configuration directory which

        On Windows the user configuration directory defaults to <code>%APPDATA%\QFS\QF-Test</code> for new
        installations. If that directory doesn't exist and you already used a QF-Test version older than 4.2 on the same
        system that created the directory <code>.qftest</code> in your home directory for the user configuration, QF-Test
        will continue to use that <code>.qftest</code> directory.<br>
        You can manually move the content of the directory <code>.qftest</code> to <code>%APPDATA%\QFS\QF-Test</code>
        and delete <code>.qftest</code> afterwards. QF-Test since version 4.2.0 will then use this directory only.
        You should not move the files if you still want to use a version older than 4.2.0!<br>

        On Linux the user configuration directory is always <code>~/.qftest</code>.<br>

        On macOS it is located at
        <code>/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Library/Application&nbsp;Support/de.qfs.apps.qftest</code>.<br>

        The personal config file is not read when QF-Test is run in batch mode (see <a href="#usec_execution">section 1.7</a>).
        Irrespective of the system default you can always specify an explicit location for the user configuration
        directory as a whole with the <a href="tech_execution.html#arg_userdir" shape="rect"><code>-userdir &lt;directory&gt;</code></a> command line argument and just for the user config file with
        <a href="tech_execution.html#arg_usercfg" shape="rect"><code>-usercfg &lt;file&gt;</code></a>.
      </p>
      
<p>
        System specific options that need to be shared between users are saved
        in a file called <code>qftest.cfg</code> in the system configuration directory which also serves as the home
        for the license file, script modules, Java plugins and other customization files.
        On Windows the location of the system configuration directory depends on the installation variant
        (c.f. <a href="#usec_install_windows">section 1.2</a>).
        It is either located in <code>%PROGRAMDATA%\QFS\QF-Test</code> or in the root directory of QF-Test. <br>

        On Linux and macOS the default system configuration directory is the root directory of QF-Test.<br>

        The location of the system config file can be changed with the command line argument and <a href="tech_execution.html#arg_systemcfg" shape="rect"><code>-systemcfg &lt;file&gt;</code></a>
        and that of the entire system directory with <a href="tech_execution.html#arg_systemdir" shape="rect"><code>-systemdir &lt;directory&gt;</code></a>.

<p>
        QF-Test can be run in two modes. In normal mode QF-Test is the editor for
        test-suites and run-logs and the control center for running programs,
        capturing events and executing tests. When run with the <a href="tech_execution.html#arg_batch" shape="rect"><code>-batch</code></a>
        argument, QF-Test goes into "batch" mode. Instead of opening an editor
        window, the test-suites given on the command line are loaded and
        executed automatically without the need for supervision. The result of
        the test is reflected in QF-Test's <a href="tech_execution.html#sec_exitcodes" shape="rect">exit code</a>,
        optional run-logs (see <a href="user_debugging.html#usec_runlog">section 7.1</a>) and reports
        (see <a href="user_report.html#usec_report">chapter 21</a>).
      </p>
      
<p>
        The setup script for Linux/Unix offers to create a symbolic link from
        <code>/usr/local/bin</code> to the <code>qftest</code> start script
        in the <code>qftest-6.0.3/bin</code> directory under
        QF-Test's root directory. That way you can simply enter
        <code>qftest</code> at the shell prompt to launch the application.
      </p>
      
<p>
        On Windows a menu shortcut is created as well as an optional desktop
        icon. You can either launch QF-Test from one of these or by
        double-clicking a test-suite or a run-log, since these files are
        associated with the QF-Test application. To run QF-Test from the
        console type <code>qftest</code>.
      </p>
      
<p>
        When run from the command line, QF-Test offers a wide range of
        arguments for customization, like selecting the Java VM to
        use. These are explained in detail in <a href="tech_execution.html#sec_execution">chapter 40</a>.
      </p>
      
<p>
        In case different versions of QF-Test are installed at the same time, a specific version can
        be started by calling the <code>qftest</code> executable directly from the respective
        <code>qftest-X.Y.Z/bin</code> directory.

        In case QF-Test is not starting up anymore because of some incorrect settings under Options-&gt;General-&gt;Startup
        the default startup settings need to be restored. This can be done through
        running the following two commands from a macOS shell terminal.
