<p>
      The previous chapters all focused on creating and organizing sets of
      reliable tests in a single test-suite. However, when testing a large
      application, a single suite may not be enough. There are at least two
      scenarios where splitting tests into multiple test-suites becomes
      essential:
    </p>
    
<ul>
      
<li>
        Multiple developers are creating and editing tests. To avoid
        redundancy and duplication of code, separately developed tests should
        use common 'Procedures' and 'Components' where possible, but only
        one person can edit a test-suite at a time.
      </li>
      
<li>
        Tests are simply getting too large. Run-logs for extensive test-runs
        may cause the system to run out of memory and organizing a large
        number of tests in a single suite is difficult. Things may become
        unwieldy. It may also be desirable to be able to run some of the tests
        as part of the whole test as well as standalone.
      </li>
    
</ul>
    
<p>
      QF-Test provides a set of advanced features that make it possible to split
      and arrange tests across a set of test-suites. Multiple developers can
      work on separate parts of a test, then coordinate their efforts, merge
      the 'Components' of their suites and create libraries of shared
      'Procedures'.
    </p>
    
<p>
      This chapter first explains the various mechanisms for distributed test
      development and how they interact. The final section then summarizes
      these in concise step-by-step instructions on how to approach large
      testing efforts with QF-Test.

</div>
<a href="contents.html#toc_usec_suitereference">Referencing nodes in another test-suite</a>
</h4>
      
<p>
        It is possible to reference <a href="procedures.html#step_Procedure" shape="rect">'Procedures'</a> and <a href="components.html#step_ComponentStep" shape="rect">'Components'</a>
        in a test-suite other than the current one. These references can be
        explicit or implicit through included files:
      </p>
      
<ul>
        
<li>
          Explicit references use a syntax similar to the one used in URLs to
          specify an item inside a web page. The referenced suite must be
          prepended to the <a href="procedures.html#att_ProcedureCall_procedure" shape="rect">'Procedure name'</a> attribute of a
          <a href="procedures.html#step_ProcedureCall" shape="rect">'Procedure call'</a> of the 'QF-Test component ID' attribute of a
          'Component' dependent node, separated by a '#' character. The
          usual <code><em>packagepath</em>.<em>procedure</em></code> becomes
          <code><em>suite</em>#<em>packagepath</em>.<em>procedure</em></code>.
        </li>
        
<li>
          Implicit references make use of the <a href="rootnode.html#att_RootStep_includes" shape="rect">'Include files'</a>
          attribute of the <a href="rootnode.html#step_RootStep" shape="rect">'Test-suite'</a> node. Whenever a node is not found
          in the current suite, QF-Test will search for a matching 'Procedure' or
          'Component' within all the suite's directly or indirectly
          included files (a file is considered indirectly included by a suite
          if it is found as an included file within one of the suite's own
          included files; for example, if suite A includes B, and suite B
          includes C, then C is indirectly included by A).
        </li>
      
</ul>
      
<p>
        A test-suite that references a node in another test-suite becomes dependent on that suite.
        If the 'Name' of a 'Procedure' or the 'QF-Test ID' of a 'Component' in the referenced
        suite changes, the suite with the reference must get updated, otherwise the link is broken
        and the suite will no longer work correctly. In such cases QF-Test will automatically update
        references if it knows about them. The best way to ensure that is to have both test-suites
        in a common project because QF-Test automatically tracks all includes and all explicit
        references within a project. Alternatively you can list the calling suite in the
        <a href="rootnode.html#att_RootStep_dependencies" shape="rect">'Dependencies (reverse includes)'</a> attribute of 'Test-suite' root node of the referenced suite.
      </p>
      
<p>
        While implicit references are more convenient in most cases, they can make tests harder to
        understand because it is not immediately obvious where the 'Procedure' or 'Component'
        referenced by some node is actually located. One possibility to find out is to select
        "Locate procedure" ([Ctrl-P]) or "Locate component"
        ([Ctrl-W]) from the context menu. Additionally, QF-Test
        provides the menu items
        &raquo;<em>Operations</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Make references explicit</em>&laquo;
        and
        &raquo;<em>Operations</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Make references implicit</em>&laquo;
        which let you toggle quickly between the two modes without changing the actually
        referenced nodes.
      </p>
      
<p>
        In both cases, the referenced suite can either be given a relative
        or absolute filename. Relative filenames will be resolved relatively to
        the directory of current suite, or - if that fails - relatively to the
        directories on the library path (see option <a href="opt_general.html#opt_libpath">Directories holding test-suite libraries</a>). Always use the forward '/' as the directory
        separator, even under Windows. QF-Test will map it to the correct character for the system it
        runs on. This keeps your test-suites independent from the operating system.
      </p>
      
<p>
        
<span class="margin"><span class="note">Note</span></span> Your 'Package' and 'Procedure' names as well as
        'Component' 'QF-Test IDs' should not contain any '\' or '#' characters.
        If they do, you need to include an escape character in the
        'Procedure call' or the 'QF-Test component ID'  attribute. See <a href="tech_quoting.html#sec_quoting">section 45.5</a> for details about escaping and quoting special
        characters.
      </p>
      
<p>
        When choosing the 'Procedure' for a 'Procedure call' or the
        'Component' for some event in the dialog, QF-Test offers a
        selection of all currently opened test-suites. If a 'Procedure' or
        'Component' from another test-suite is selected, QF-Test
        automatically creates the correct reference, taking included suites
        into account. When the test is run at a later time, the referenced
        test-suite is loaded automatically if necessary.
      </p>
      
<p>
        During execution QF-Test keeps a stack of currently executing suites.
        Whenever a 'Procedure' is called in another suite, the called suite is
        pushed on to the top of this stack and removed when execution returns
        to the calling suite. Whenever during the execution of a 'Procedure' a
        'Window' or 'Component' is
        referenced by its QF-Test ID, QF-Test searches through this stack of suites from
        the top to the bottom, i.e. first in the test-suite of the called
        'Procedure' and then in the calling suite, always checking any
        included files along the way. This process is quite complicated and
        you should take care to keep your include hierarchies simple. In case
        you encounter problems anyway, a detailed explanation is given in
        <a href="tech_includes.html#tsec_includes">section 45.6</a>.

</div>
<a href="contents.html#toc_usec_manageComponents">Managing 'Components'</a>
</h4>
      
<p>
        As we have emphasized in <a href="user_components.html#usec_components">chapter 5</a>, the
        'Components' are the essential part of a test-suite. If the SUT
        changes between releases, these will likely be affected most. If
        changes are so massive that QF-Test cannot adapt automatically, the
        'Components' will have to be updated manually. This is why you
        should try to avoid redundancy in the 'Component' hierarchy of
        your tests more than in any other part.
      </p>
      
<p>
        Therefore, when splitting your tests across multiple test-suites you
        should try to keep the 'Components' together in one central
        test-suite and include this suite from the other suites. For very
        large applications you may want to split the 'Component' hierarchy
        into parts, each related to a separate part of the SUT's GUI.
      </p>
      
<p>
        Maintaining this central 'Component' library is not trivial.
        The problems that will arise can be resolved with QF-Test as follows:
      </p>
      
<ul>
        
<li>
          When multiple test developers are recording new 'Components'
          simultaneously, they cannot be integrated immediately into the
          central suite, because only one user can edit the central suite at a
          time. Instead, 'Components' must be integrated later by
          importing them into the central suite when the new tests have
          stabilized. This is explained in the following section.
        </li>
        
<li>
          When the SUT changes, 'Components' in the central suite may
          need to be updated. If this involves changing any 'Component'
          'QF-Test IDs', this will break any references to these 'Components'
          from other suites. To avoid that, QF-Test must update those references
          and it will do so, provided that the suites that depend on the
          central suite are currently loaded, belong to the same project or are listed in the
          <a href="rootnode.html#att_RootStep_dependencies" shape="rect">'Dependencies (reverse includes)'</a> attribute of the <a href="rootnode.html#step_RootStep" shape="rect">'Test-suite'</a> node of
          the central suite.
        </li>
      
</ul>

</h4>
      
<p>
        Test-suites can be merged by importing one test-suite into another
        with the
        &raquo;<em>File</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Import...</em>&laquo; menu item.
        </p>
      
      
<p>
        You can select the areas of the test-suite, which should be imported.
      </p>
      
<p>
        You have to take care about a correct Include/Reverse-Include of your
        test-suites to ensure, that all calls and component references  are
        still valid. See <a href="bp_organize.html#sec_bpOrganize">chapter 33</a> for details.

</h5>
        
<p>
          During import, all 'Windows' and 'Components' of the imported
          test-suite are integrated into the component hierarchy of the
          importing suite. 'Components' that already exist are not copied.
          A 'QF-Test ID' conflict (identical components with different 'QF-Test IDs' or
          differing components with identical 'QF-Test IDs') is resolved
          automatically by changing the 'QF-Test ID' of the imported component.
        </p>
        
<p>
          Afterwards, all 'Windows' and 'Components' are removed from
          the imported suite. All nodes in the imported suite that referred to
          these 'Components' are updated accordingly. Ideally, the imported
          suite should include the importing suite so no explicit suite
          references will have to be created.

 Importing Procedures and Testcases</a>
</h5>
           
<p>
          As you can import 'Components' QF-Test also allows to import
          'Procedures', 'Packages', 'Dependencies' and 'Test-cases' as well as
          'Test-sets' by choosing 'Procedures' or 'Tests' in the import dialog.
          You should take care about keeping all calls consistent, e.g. in
          most cases it does not make sense to import 'Procedures' without their
          required 'Components'.
        </p>
        
<p>
          In case you only want to import one dedicated 'Procedure' or
          'Test-case' you can use the button 'Detailimport' on the
          importdialog. Here you can choose any node you want to import separately.

</h4>
      
<p>
        There is no single <em>best way</em> of test development or
        organization, but one approach that works well is the following:
      </p>
      
<ul>
        
<li>
          Start with a central test-suite that has the functionality needed to
          start and stop the SUT and a basic set of 'Tests' and
          'Procedures'. This will become your master suite which will contain
          all 'Components'.
        </li>
        
<li>
          Make sure that your developers have understood the importance of
          assigning names with <code>setName()</code> and that unique names
          are assigned consistently where needed. Where <code>setName()</code>
          is not an option, try to implement
          <code>ComponentNameResolvers</code> to achieve this (see <a href="tech_resolversmodule.html#sec_nameresolver">subsection 50.1.6</a>). You should be able to record and replay
          sequences without much ado and without "polluting" the
          'Component' hierarchy after trivial changes in the user
          interface.
        </li>
        
<li>
          Move as much functionality as possible into 'Procedures', especially
          commonly-used stuff and the setup and cleanup routines for the
          SUT.
        </li>
        
<li>
          To create new tests, start with an empty test-suite. Include the
          master test-suite by editing the <a href="rootnode.html#att_RootStep_includes" shape="rect">'Include files'</a> attribute
          of the <a href="rootnode.html#step_RootStep" shape="rect">'Test-suite'</a> node of the new suite. Create the
          'Setup' and 'Cleanup' nodes to start and stop the
          SUT by calling the respective 'Procedures' in the master suite.
        </li>
        
<li>
          Create your tests as required. When recording sequences, the
          'Components' of the master-suite will be used if possible. New
          'Components' are added to the new suite, so the master suite
          will not be modified at this stage.
        </li>
        
<li>
          Where possible, call 'Procedures' in the master suite for common
          operations.
        </li>
        
<li>
          When your new set of tests is complete and you are satisfied that
          they work well, import any required nodes of your new test-suite
          into the master suite.
          You have to ensure that all new 'Component' nodes that you
          recorded are imported into the master suite's 'Component'
          hierarchy in any case. The master suite's existing 'Components' will not be
          affected by this, so other suites that depend on the master suite
          will not need to be modified.
        </li>
        
<li>
          After importing 'Components' you can import all or only the
          required 'Procedures' into the master suite.
        </li>
        
<li>
          You now have various options of how to arrange the actual sequences
          of events and checks that form your tests. In any case it is a good
          idea to move everything to 'Procedures' and 'Packages' structured
          after your test-plan. Then the top-level 'Test-set' or 'Test-case' nodes of the master
          suite and your new suite will only contain the required hierarchy of
          'Test-set', 'Test-case', 'Test-step' and 'Sequence' nodes filled with 'Procedure calls' to the
          actual test-cases. Such an arrangement has several advantages:
          <ul>
            
<li>
              All your tests are structured cleanly.
            </li>
            
<li>
              You can easily create different sets of tests with varying
              complexity and run-time.
            </li>
            
<li>
              You have the option to keep the test-cases in separate
              test-suites and have the master suite call them. These
              "test-case-libraries" must include the master-suite, so they
              need not contain any 'Components' themselves. You can
              organize your tests so that the master-suite will run the whole
              set of tests, while each separate suite can also be run
              standalone.
            </li>
            
<li>
              The tests can be maintained by several developers as long as
              modifications to the master suite are coordinated.
            </li>
          
</ul>
        
</li>
        
<li>
          If you decide to keep your new tests in the newly created test-suite instead of moving
          them to the master suite, modify the master suite to tell QF-Test that there is a new
          test-suite that depends on it. To do so, either ensure that both test-suites belong to
          the same project or add the new test-suite to the <a href="rootnode.html#att_RootStep_dependencies" shape="rect">'Dependencies'</a> attribute
          of the master suite's 'Test-suite' node.
        </li>
        
<li>
          If you need to modify or extend the new test-suite later, proceed as
          before. You can record new sequences as needed. When you are done,
          merge any newly created 'Components' back into the master suite.
        </li>
        
<li>
          If your SUT changes in a way that requires updates or adaptions to
          the master-suite's 'Component' hierarchy, you must coordinate
          your test developers. Before you start updating the
          'Components', make sure that all suites that directly or
          indirectly include the master suite belong to the same project as the master suite or
          are listed in the
          'Dependencies' attribute of the master suite's 'Test-suite' node.
          If modifying the 'Components' of the master suite involves any
          'QF-Test component ID' changes, QF-Test will update the depending test-suites
          accordingly, so they should not be edited simultaneously by others.
        </li>
        
<li>
          The file format for QF-Test test-suites is XML and thus plain text. As a
          result, test-suites can be managed very well by version control
          systems like CVS. Changes to some 'QF-Test component ID' attributes of the
          depending suites can typically be merged with other changes without
          conflicts, alleviating the need for coordination.
        </li>
      
</ul>
      
<p>
        Of course, the above scheme can be extended to have several master
        suites for testing different parts or aspects of an application. It
        may be a good idea to ensure that the component hierarchies in these
        suites don't overlap too much though. This will save you the effort of
        maintaining all these hierarchies in case the user interface of the
        SUT changes significantly.

<p>
        Working in a project over time will cause
        modifications, refactoring or deletion of steps in
        your test-suite structure, e.g. you may consider renaming
        'Procedures' or simply removing them once they are not required anymore.
      </p>

</div>
<a href="contents.html#toc_sec_N91760">Avoiding invalid references</a>
</h5>

    
<p>
          In such cases it is quite important that you adapt all references of
          the according 'Procedure' in order to guarantee that the remaining
          tests keep running. For this purpose QF-Test automatically updates
          all references during the process of renaming or moving elements on demand.
    </p>
    
<p>
          If you want to ensure that your created test structure doesn't
          contain any call of non-existing 'Procedures' anymore, you can also use
          the "Analyze references" command of QF-Test in order to perform a static
          validation of your test-suite. This command will open a dialog showing
          all references and whether they are still okay or something is missing.
    </p>
    
<p>
          You can trigger the analysis via a right mouse-click and
          selecting &raquo;<em>Additional node operations</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Analyze references...</em>&laquo; or selecting
          the according entry from the main menu under &raquo;<em>Operations</em>&laquo;. This method is also available in batch mode.

        QF-Test also provides features to search through your test-suites for
        duplicate nodes, empty
        'Packages' or 'Procedures' or to analyze for nodes having invalid
        characters in their names.
    </p>
    
<p>
          This kind of static validation is available for 'Procedures', 'Dependencies',
          'Test-cases', 'Test-sets' and 'Components' and their references.

</div>
<a href="contents.html#toc_usec_find_unused_procedures">Unused procedures</a>
</h5>

    
<p>
          During test development it could happen that procedures, which were used in the first version
      of your tests will not be used in newer versions due to re-factoring of tests.
      If those procedures won't get deleted immediately
      they will stay in the test-suite and the test-suite will grow and grow.
      Sometimes you could get the feeling that you have too many procedures or that you
      have lost the overview of your procedures. In order to check for such unused procedures or dependencies
      in your test-suite you can open the context menu via a right mouse click at 'Test-suite' or 'Procedures' and
      select &raquo;<em>Additional node operations</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Find unused callables...</em>&laquo;. This operation creates a report showing
      any procedures or dependencies which had been created but haven't been used yet. Now you could decide what
      you want to do with those.
    </p>
    
<p>
      Sometimes you might simply remove all of those unused nodes immediately via
      &raquo;<em>Additional node operations</em>&laquo;-&raquo;<em>Remove unused callables</em>&laquo;.
