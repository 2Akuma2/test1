1.	License to Use.  Licensee is granted a non-exclusive and non-transferable license ("License") to use the Software to assist in the development of Java compatible software programs using InfoBus 1.1 software running on JDK 1.1 ("Developed Programs"), including programs which incorporate some or all of the packages which make up the Software.

2.	Java Platform Interface. Licensee may not modify the Java Platform Interface ("JPI", identified as classes contained within the "java" package or any subpackages of the "java" package), by creating additional classes within the JPI or otherwise causing the addition to or modification of the classes in the JPI. In the event that Licensee creates any Java-related API and distributes such API to others for applet or application development, Licensee must promptly publish an accurate specification for such API for free use by all developers of Java-based software.

3.	Restrictions. Software is copyrighted and title to all copies is retained by Sun and/or its licensors.  Licensee shall reproduce and apply all proprietary rights notices which appear on or in the Software on or in any copies of the Software made by Licensee.  Unless enforcement of this provision is prohibited by applicable law, and only to that extent, Licensee shall not modify, decompile, disassemble, decrypt, extract, or otherwise reverse engineer Software.  Software is not designed or licensed for use in on-line control equipment in hazardous environments such as operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or control, or direct life support machines.

4.	Confidentiality.  Software is confidential and proprietary information of Sun and/or its licensors.  Licensee agrees to take adequate steps to protect Software from unauthorized disclosure or use.

6.	Limitation of Liability.  IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT, OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7.	Termination.  This License is effective until terminated.  Licensee may terminate this License at any time by destroying all copies of Software including any documentation.  This License will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if Licensee fails to comply with any provision of this License.  Upon termination, Licensee must destroy all copies of Software.

8.	Export Regulations.  Software, including technical data, is subject to U.S. export control laws, including the U.S. Export Administration Act and its associated regulations, and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.  Licensee agrees to comply strictly with all such regulations and acknowledges that it has the responsibility to obtain licenses to export, re-export, or import Software.

9.	 U.S. Government Restricted Rights.  Use, duplication or disclosure of the Software by the U.S. Government is subject to restrictions of FAR 52.227-14(g)(2)(6/87) and FAR 52.227-19(6/87), or DFAR 252.227-7015(b)(6/95) and DFAR 227.7202-3(a).

11.	Severability.  If any of the above provisions are held to be in violation of applicable law, void, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, then such provisions are herewith waived to the extent necessary for the License to be otherwise enforceable in such jurisdiction.  However, if in Sun's opinion deletion of any provisions of the License by operation of this paragraph unreasonably compromises the rights or liabilities of Sun or its licensors, Sun reserves the right to terminate the License and refund the fee paid by Licensee as Licensee's sole and exclusive remedy.

This Agreement is the entire agreement between Licensee and Sun relating to Software and: (i) supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations with respect to its subject matter; and (ii) prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or similar communication between the parties during the term of this Agreement.
